  <head>A<lb />BANKRUPT</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>S made by breaking, as a
  Bird is hatched<lb />by breaking the Shell, for he gains more<lb />by
  giving over his Trade, than ever he did by<lb />dealing in it. He
  drives a Trade, as
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Oliver</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Cromwel</hi>
  did a Coach, till it broke in Pieces.<lb />He is very tender and
  careful in preſerving<lb />his Credit, and keeps it as methodically as
  a<lb />Race-nag is dieted, that in the End he may<lb />run away with
  it: for he observes a punctual<lb />Curioſity in performing his Word,
  until he<lb />has improved his Credit as far as it can go ;<lb />and
  then he has catched the Fiſh, and throws<lb />away the Net ; as a
  Butcher, when he has fed<lb />his Beaſt as fat as it can grow, cuts
  the Throat<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>of it. When he has brought his Deſign to<lb />Perfection, and
  diſpoſed of all his Materials,<lb />he lays his Train, like a Powder
  Traytor, and<lb />gets out of the way, while he blows up
  all<lb />thoſe that truſted him. After the Blow is<lb />given there is
  no Manner of Intelligence to be<lb />had of him for ſome Months, until
  the Rage<lb />and Fury is ſomewhat digeſted, and all
  Hopes<lb />vaniſhed of ever recovering any Thing of Body,<lb />or
  Goods, for Revenge, or Reſtitution ; and<lb />then Propoſitions of
  Treaty and Accommoda-<lb />tion appear, like the Sign of the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hand and Pen</hi><lb />out of the
  Clouds, with Conditions more un-<lb />reaſonable than Thieves are wont
  to demand<lb />for Reſtitution of ſtolen Goods. He ſhoots<lb />like a
  Fowler at a whole Flock of Geeſe at<lb />once, and ſtalks with his
  Horſe to come as near<lb />as poſſibly he can without being perceived
  by<lb />any one, or giving the leaſt Suſpicion of his<lb />Deſign,
  until it is too late to prevent it ; and<lb />then he flies from them,
  as they ſhould have<lb />done before from him. His Way is ſo
  com-<lb />monly uſed in the City, that he robs in a Road,<lb />like a
  Highwayman, and yet they will never<lb />arrive at Wit enough to avoid
  it ; for it is done<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>upon Surpriſe ; and as Thieves are commonly<lb />better mounted
  than thoſe they rob, he very<lb />eaſily makes his Eſcape, and flies
  beyond Per-<lb />ſuit of Huon-cries, and there is no
  Poſſibility<lb />of overtaking him.<lb /></p>
