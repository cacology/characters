  <head>AN<lb />AMORIST</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>s an Artificer, or Maker
  of Love, a ſworn<lb />Servant to all Ladies, like an Officer in
  a<lb />Corporation. Though no one in particular<lb />will own any
  Title to him, yet he never fails,<lb />upon all Occaſions, to offer
  his Services, and<lb />they as ſeldom to turnn it back again
  untouched.<lb />He commits nothing with them, but himſelf
  to<lb />their good Graces ; and they recommend him<lb />back again to
  his own, where he finds ſo kind<lb />a Reception, that he wonders how
  he does<lb />fail of it every where elſe. His Paſſion is
  as<lb />eaſily ſet on Fire as a Fart, and as ſoon out<lb />again. He
  is charged an primed with Love-<lb />Powder like a Gun, and the leaſt
  Sparkle of an<lb />Eye gives Fire to him, and off he goes,
  but<lb />ſeldom, or never, hits the Mark. He has com-<lb />mon Places
  and Precedents of Repartees and<lb />Letters for all Occaſions ; and
  falls as readily<lb />into his Method of making love, as a
  Parſon<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>does into his Form of Matrimony. He con- verſes, as Angela are ſaid
  to do, by Intuition, and expreſſes himſelf by Sighs moſt ſignificant-
  ly. He follows his Viſits, as Men do their Buſineſs, and is very
  induſtrious in waiting on the Ladies, where his Affairs lie ; among
  which thoſe of greateſt Concernment are
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Queſtions and Commands, Purpoſes,</hi>
  and other ſuch received Forms of With and Converſation ; in which he
  is ſo deeply ſtudied, that in all Queſtions and Doubts that ariſe, he
  is appealed to, and very learnedly declares, which was the moſt true
  and primitive Way of proceeding in the pureſt Times. For theſe Virtues
  he never fails of his Summons to all Balls, where he manages the
  Country-Dances with ſingular Judgment, and is frequently an Aſſiſtant
  at L'hombre; and theſe are all the Uſes they make of his Parts, beſide
  the Sport they give themſelves in laughing at him, which he takes for
  ſingular Favours, and interprets to his own Advantage, though it never
  goes further; for all his Employments being public, he is never
  admitted to any pri- vate Services, and they deſpiſe him as not Wo-
  man's Meat: For he applies to too many to be truſted by any one; as
  Baſtards by having many Fathers, have none at all. He goes often</p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>mounted in a Coach as a Convoy, to guard the<lb />Ladies, to take
  the Duſt in <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hyde-Park</hi>;
  where<lb />by his prudent Management of the Glaſs Win-<lb />dows he
  ſecures them from Beggars, and re-<lb />turns fraught with
  China-Oranges and Ballads.<lb />Thus he is but a Gentleman-Uſher
  General,<lb />and his Buſineſs is to carry one Lady's Services<lb />to
  another, and bring back the others in Ex-<lb />change.<lb /></p>
