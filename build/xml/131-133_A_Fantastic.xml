  <p>[Double line capital]Is one that wears his Feather on the
  Ins<hi rendition="simple:italic">ide<lb />of his Head. His Brain is
  like Quicks</hi>ilver,<lb />apt to receive any
  Impres<hi rendition="simple:italic">s</hi>ion, but retain
  none.<lb />His Mind is made of changeable Stuff, that<lb />alters
  Colour with every Motion towards the<lb />Light. He is a Cormorant,
  that has but one<lb />Gut, devours every Thing greedily, but it
  runs<lb />through him immediately. He does not
  know<lb />s<hi rendition="simple:italic">o much as what he would be,
  and yet would<lb />be every Thing he knows. He is like a
  Paper-<lb />Lanthorn, that turns with the Smoak of a<lb />Candle. He
  wears his Cloaths, as the antient<lb />Laws of the Land have provided,
  according<lb />to his Quality, that he may be known what<lb />he is by
  them; and it is as eas</hi>y to decipher<lb />him by his Habit as a

  Fas</hi>hion, as others are of<lb />a Faction, and glories as much to
  be in the<lb />Head of a Mode, as a Solider does to be in<lb />the
  Head of an Army. He is admirably
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">kil-<lb />ful in the Mathematics of
  Cloaths; and can<lb />tell, at the firs</hi>t View, whether they have
  the<lb />right Symmetry. He alters his Gate with the<lb />Times, and
  has not a Motion of his Body, that<lb />(like a Dottrel) he does not
  borrow from s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ome-<lb />body els</hi>e.
  He exercis<hi rendition="simple:italic">es his Limbs, like
  the<lb />Pike and Mus</hi>ket, and all his
  Pos<hi rendition="simple:italic">tures are prac-<lb />tis</hi>ed--Take
  him all together, and he is nothing<lb />but a

  Plas<hi rendition="simple:italic">ter of [i] Paris, [i] and<lb />a

  His<lb />Head is as full of Maggots as a Pas</hi>toral
