  <head>A RANTER</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>s a
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fanatic</hi> Hector, that has found out
  by a very ſtrange Way of new Light, how to transform all the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Devils</hi> into
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Angels of Light</hi> ; for he believes
  all Religion conſiſts in Looſeneſs, and that Sin and Vice is
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">the whole Duty of Man</hi>. He puts off
  the <hi rendition="simple:italic">old Man</hi>, but puts it on again
  upon the <hi rendition="simple:italic">new one,</hi> and makes his
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pagan</hi> Vices ſerve to preſerve his
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſtian</hi> Virtues from wearing out
  ; for if he ſhould uſe his Piety and Devotion al- ways it would hold
  out but a little while. He is loth that Iniquity and Vice ſhould be
  thrown away, as long as there may be good Uſe of it ; for if that,
  which is wickedly gotten, may be diſposed to pious Uſes, why ſhould
  not Wickedneſs itſelf as well? He believes himſelf Shot-free againſt
  all the Attempts of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Devil,</hi> the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">World,</hi> and the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Flesh,</hi> and therefore is not afraid
  to attack them in their own Quarters, and encounter them at their own
  Weapons.</p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>For as ſtrong Bodies may freely venture to do,<lb />and ſuffer
  that, without any Hurt to them-<lb />ſelves, which would deſtroy thoſe
  that are<lb />feeble: So a Saint, that is ſtrong in Grace,<lb />may
  boldly engage himſelf in thoſe great Sins<lb />and Iniquities, that
  would eaſily damn a weak<lb />Brother, and yet come off never the
  worſe.<lb />He believes Deeds of Darkneſs to be only thoſe<lb />Sins
  that are committed in private, not thoſe<lb />that are acted openly
  and owned. He is but<lb />an
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hypocrite</hi> turned the wrong Side
  outward ;<lb />for, as the one wears his Vices within, and<lb />the
  other without, ſo when they are counter-<lb />changed the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ranter</hi> becomes an
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hypocrite,</hi> and<lb />the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hypocrite</hi> an able
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ranter.</hi> His Church is<lb />the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Devil's</hi> Chappel ; for it agrees
  exactly both<lb />in Doctorine and Diſicipline with the beſt
  reform-<lb />ed Baudy-Houſes. He is a Monſter produced<lb />by the
  Madneſs of this latter Age ; but if it<lb />had been his Fate to have
  been whelped in old<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Rome</hi> he
  had paſt for a Prodigy, and been re-<lb />ceived among raining of
  Stones and the ſpeak-<lb />ing of Bulls, and would have put a ſtop to
  all<lb />public Affairs, until he had been
  expiated.<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Nero</hi> cloathed
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſtians</hi> in the Skins of
  wild<lb />Beaſts ; but he wraps wild Beaſts in the Skins<lb />of
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſtians</hi>.<lb /></p>
