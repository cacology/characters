  William<lb />Prynne [i] will s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ooner lend

  Meas<hi rendition="simple:italic">ure of Talk is till his<lb />Wind is
  s</hi>pent; and then he is not
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ilenced,<lb />but becalmed. His Ears
  have catched the<lb />Itch of his Tonuge, and though he
  s</hi>cratch<lb />them, like a Beas<hi rendition="simple:italic">t
  with his Hoof, he finds a<lb />Pleas</hi>ure in it. A [i]
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ilenced Minis</hi>ter, [i] has
  more<lb />Mercy on the Government in a
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ecure Conven-<lb />ticle, than he has
  on the Company, that he is<lb />in. He s</hi>hakes a Man by the Ear,
  as a Dog<lb />does a Pig, and never
  loos<hi rendition="simple:italic">es his Hold, till he<lb />has tired
  hims</hi>elf, as well as his Patient. He<lb />does not talk to a Man,
  but attack him, and<lb />whoms<hi rendition="simple:italic">oever he
  can get into his Hands he lays<lb />violent Language on. If he can he
  will run<lb />a Man up agains</hi>t a Wall, and hold him at

  as bad<lb />as he does his Pers<hi rendition="simple:italic">on, or
  the Bus</hi>ines<hi rendition="simple:italic">s he treats<lb />upon.
  When he finds him begin to s</hi>ink, he<lb />holds him by the
  Cloaths, and feels him as a<lb />Butcher does a Calf, before he kills
  him. He<lb />is a walking Pillory, and crucifies more Ears<lb />than a
  dozen s<hi rendition="simple:italic">tanding ones. He will hold
  any<lb />Argument rather than his Tongue, and main-<lb />tain both
  s</hi>ides at his own Charge; for he will<lb />tell you what you will
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ay, though, perhaps,<lb />he does not
  intend to give you leave. He<lb />lugs Men by the Ears, as they
  correct Children<lb />in [i] Scotland, [i] and will make them tingle,
  while<lb />he talks with them, as s</hi>ome
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ay they will do,<lb />when a Man is
  talked of in his Abs</hi>ence. When<lb />he talks to a Man, he comes
  up clos<hi rendition="simple:italic">e to him,<lb />and like an old
  Solider lets fly in his Face, or<lb />claps the Bore of his
  Pis</hi>tol to his Ear, and<lb />whispers aloud, that he may be
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ure not to<lb />mis</hi>s his Mark. His
  tongue is always in Mo-<lb />tion, tho very
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">eldom to the Purpos</hi>e, like
  a<lb />Barber's Scis<hi rendition="simple:italic">s</hi>ers, which are
  always s<hi rendition="simple:italic">nipping,<lb />as well when they
  do not cut, as when they<lb />do. His Tongue is like a Bagpipe Drone,
  that<lb />has no Stop, but makes a continual ugly
  Nois</hi>e,<lb />hims*elf. He never leaves a Man until he
