A
BANKRUPT


I²S made by breaking, as a Bird is hatched
by breaking the Shell, for he gains more
by giving over his Trade, than ever he did by
dealing in it. He drives a Trade, as _Oliver_
_Cromwel_ did a Coach, till it broke in Pieces.
He is very tender and careful in preſerving
his Credit, and keeps it as methodically as a
Race-nag is dieted, that in the End he may
run away with it: for he observes a punctual
Curioſity in performing his Word, until he
has improved his Credit as far as it can go ;
and then he has catched the Fiſh, and throws
away the Net ; as a Butcher, when he has fed
his Beaſt as fat as it can grow, cuts the Throat

of it. When he has brought his Deſign to
Perfection, and diſpoſed of all his Materials,
he lays his Train, like a Powder Traytor, and
gets out of the way, while he blows up all
thoſe that truſted him. After the Blow is
given there is no Manner of Intelligence to be
had of him for ſome Months, until the Rage
and Fury is ſomewhat digeſted, and all Hopes
vaniſhed of ever recovering any Thing of Body,
or Goods, for Revenge, or Reſtitution ; and
then Propoſitions of Treaty and Accommoda-
tion appear, like the Sign of the _Hand and Pen_
out of the Clouds, with Conditions more un-
reaſonable than Thieves are wont to demand
for Reſtitution of ſtolen Goods. He ſhoots
like a Fowler at a whole Flock of Geeſe at
once, and ſtalks with his Horſe to come as near
as poſſibly he can without being perceived by
any one, or giving the leaſt Suſpicion of his
Deſign, until it is too late to prevent it ; and
then he flies from them, as they ſhould have
done before from him. His Way is ſo com-
monly uſed in the City, that he robs in a Road,
like a Highwayman, and yet they will never
arrive at Wit enough to avoid it ; for it is done

------------------------------------------------------------------------

upon Surpriſe ; and as Thieves are commonly
better mounted than thoſe they rob, he very
eaſily makes his Eſcape, and flies beyond Per-
ſuit of Huon-cries, and there is no Poſſibility
of overtaking him.
