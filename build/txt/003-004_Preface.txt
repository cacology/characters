PREFACE.


_T²HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit_
_much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt_
_Century. The two principal Authors in this Way_
_were Sir_ Thomas Overbury, _and Dr._ John
Earle _Tutor to Prince_ Charles _in_ 1643, _and after_
_the Reſtoration Dean of_ Weſtminſter, _and ſuc-_
_ceſſively Biſhop of_ Worceſter _and_ Saliſbury. _How_
_agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public_
_Taſte may be judged from Sir_ Thomas’s _little Book_
_having fourteen Editions before_ 1632, _and the_
_Biſhop’s ſix between_ 1628 _and_ 1633. _Whether_
Butler _has equalled or excelled them, and what_
_Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt_
_be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-_
_reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me_
_a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge. The Reader_
_will have an Opportunity of determining for him-_
_ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame_
_Pictures._
[_a test to see if it deploys_]

_As in ſuch a Variety of Characters there muſt_
_be ſome drawn from Originals in general the ſame,_
_and only differenced by particular Circumſtances,_
_the ſame Obſervations are ſometimes repeated._
_Whether the Author in this Caſe requires any Apo-_
_logy muſt be left to his Judges the Critics ; it is_
_enough for me that I can ſay I have done him_
_Justice in publiſhing them._

_As moſt of theſe Characters are dated when they_
_were compoſed, I can inform the curious, that they_
_were chiefly drawn up from_ 1667 _to_ 1669, _at_
_which time, as has been before obſerved,_ Butler
_reſided in_ Wales _under the Protection of Lord_
Carbery.
