DOUBLE RULE

CENTER MELANCHOLY MAN



[DOUBLE LINE INITIAL CAP]IS ONE, THAT KEEPS THE WORS_T COMPANY IN THE
WORLD, THAT IS, HIS OWN; AND THO' HE BE AL-
WAYS FALLING OUT AND QUARRELLING WITH HIMS_ELF,
YET HE HAS NOT POWER TO ENDURE ANY OTHER CON-
VERS_ATION. HIS HEAD IS HAUNTED, LIKE A HOUS_E,
WITH EVIL SPIRITS AND APPARITIONS, THAT TERRIFY
AND FRIGHT HIM OUT OF HIMS_ELF, TILL HE S_TANDS
EMPTY AND FORS_AKEN. HIS SLEEPS AND HIS WA-
KINGS ARE S_O MUCH THE S_AME, THAT HE KNOWS NOT
HOW TO DIS_TINGUIS_H THEM, AND MANY TIMES
WHEN HE DREAMS, HE BELIEVES HE IS BROAD AWAKE
AND S_EES VIS_IONS. THE FUMES AND VAPOURS
THAT RIS_E FROM HIS SPLEEN AND HYPOCONDRIES
HAVE S_O S_MUTCHED AND S_ULLIED HIS BRAIN (LIKE A
ROOM THAT S_MOAKS) THAT HIS UNDERS_TANDING IS
BLEAR-EY'D, AND HAS NO RIGHT PERCEPTION OF ANY
THING. HIS SOUL LIVES IN HIS BODY, LIKE A
MOLE IN THE EARTH, THAT LABOURS IN THE DARK,
AND CAS_TS UP DOUBTS AND SCRUPLES OF HIS OWN

IMAGINATION, TO MAKE THAT RUGGED AND UNEAS_Y,
THAT WAS PLAIN AND OPEN BEFORE. HIS BRAIN IS
S_O CRACKED, THAT HE FANCIES HIMS_ELF TO BE GLAS_S,
AND IS AFRAID THAT EVERY THING HE COMES NEAR
S_HOULD BREAK HIM IN PIECES. WHATS_OEVER MAKES
AN IMPRES_S_ION IN HIS IMAGINATION WORKS IT S_ELF
IN LIKE A SCREW, AND THE MORE HE TURNS AND
WINDS IT, THE DEEPER IT S_TICKS, TILL IT IS NEVER TO
BE GOT OUT AGAIN. THE TEMPER OF HIS BRAIN
BEING EARTHY, COLD, AND DRY, IS APT TO BREED
WORMS, THAT S_INK S_O DEEP INTO IT, NO MEDICINE
IN ART OR NATURE IS ABLE TO REACH THEM. HE
LEADS HIS LIFE, AS ONE LEADS A DOG IN A SLIP
THAT WILL NOT FOLLOW, BUT IS DRAGGED ALONG UNTIL
HE IS ALMOS_T HANGED, AS HE HAS IT OFTEN UNDER
CONS_IDERATION TO TREAT HIMS_ELF IN CONVENIENT
TIME AND PLACE, IF HE CAN BUT CATCH HIMS_ELF
ALONE. AFTER A LONG AND MORTAL FEUD BETWEEN
HIS INWARD AND HIS OUTWARD MAN, THEY AT
LENGTH AGREE TO MEET WITHOUT SECONDS, AND DECIDE THE
QUARREL, IN WHICH THE ONE DROPS, AND THE
OTHER S_INKS OUT FO THE WAY, AND MAKES HIS
ES_CAPE INTO S_OME FOREIGN WORLD, FROM WHENCE
IS IT NEVER AFTER HEARD OF. HE CONVERS_ES WITH
NOTHING S_O MUCH AS HIS OWN IMAGINATION,
WHICH BEING APT TO MIS_REPRES*ENT THINGS TO HIM,

makes him believe, that it is s_omething els_e
than it is, and that he holds Intelligence with
Spirits, that reveal whats_oever he fancies to
him, as the antient rude People, that firs_t heard
their own Voices repeated by Echoes in the
Woods, concluded it mus_t proceed from s_ome
invisible Inhabitants of thos_e s_olitary Places,
which they after believed to be Gods, and
called them [i] Sylvans, Fauns, [i] and [i] Dryads. [i] He
makes the Infirmity of his Temper pas_s for
Revelations, as [i] Mahomet [i] did by his falling
Sicknes_s, and ins_pires hims_elf with the Wind
of his own Hypocondries. He laments, like
[i] Heraclitus [i] the Maudlin Philos_opher, at other
Men's Mirth, and take Pleas_ures in nothing
but his own un-s_ober Sadnes_s. His Mind is
full of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like
a Nes_t of Boxes. He s_leeps little, but dreams
much, and s_oundes_t when he is waking. He
s_ees Vis_ions further off than a s_econd-s_ighted
Man in [i] Scotland, [i] and dreams upon a hard
Point with admirable Judgement. He is jus_t
s_o much wors_e than a Madman, as he is below
him in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen
the mos_t mad govern all the res*t, and receive
a natural Obedience from their Inferiors.
