prefers his Church merely for the Antiquity of
it, and cares not how s_ound or rotten it be,
s_o it be but old. He takes a liking to it as
s_ome do to old Chees_e, only for the blue Rot-
tennes_s of it. If he had lived in the primitive
Times he had never been a (i) Christian (i); for the
Antiquity of the (i) Pagan (i) and (i) Jewish (i) Religion
would have had the s_ame Power over him
against the (i) Christian, (i) as the old (i) Roman (i) has
agains_t the modern Reformation. The weaker
Ves_s_el he is, the better and more zealous Member
he always proves of his Church; for Religion,
like Wine, is not s_o apt to leak in a leathern
Boraccio as a great Cas_k, and is better pre-

GREAT ARGUMENT THAT HE IS MISTAKEN. HIS RE-
LIGION IS OF NO FORCE WITHOUT CEREMONIES, LIKE

THAT USED TO KILL SCHOOLMASTERS ; AND HE VALUES
THEM BY NUMBER, NOT WEIGHT.
