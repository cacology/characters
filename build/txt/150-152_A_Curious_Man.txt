[V]ALUES things not by their Us_e or
[V]Worth, but Scarcity. He is very tender
and s_crupulous of his Humour, as [i] Fantatics [i]
are of their Cons_ciences, and both for the mos_t
part in Trifles. He cares not how unus_eful
any Thing be, s_o it be but unus_ual and rare.
He collects all the Curious_ities he can light upon
in Art or Nature, not to inform his own
Judgement, but to catch the Admiration of o-
thers, which he believes he has a Right to, be-
caus_e the Rarities are his own. That which
other Men neglect he believes they overs_ee,
and s_tores up Trifles as rare Dis_coveries, at leas_t
of his own Wit and Sagacity. He admires
subtleties above all Things, becaus_e the more
s_ubtle they are, the nearer they are to nothing;
and values no Art but that which is s_pun s*o

THIN, THAT IT IS OF NO US_E AT ALL. HE HAD RATHER
HAVE AN IRON CHAIN HUNG ABOUT THE NECK OF A
FLEA, THAN AN ALDERMAN'S OF GOLD, AND [I] HO-
MER'S [I] ILIADS IN A NUTS_HEL THAN [I] ALEXANDER'S [I] CA-

ON A CHERRY-STONE, THAN THOS_E ON ST. [I] PETER'S [I]
PORTICO, AND WOULD WILLINGLY S_ELL [I] CHRIST [I] AGAIN
FOR THE NUMERICAL PIECE OF COIN, THAT [I] JUDAS [I]
TOOK FOR HIM. HIS PERPETUAL DOTAGE UPON
CURIOUS_ITIES AT LENGTH RENDERS HIM ONE OF THEM,
AND HE S_HEWS HIMS_ELF AS NONE FO THE MEANES_T
OF HIS RARITIES. HE S_O MUCH AFFECTS SINGULA-
RITY, THAT RATHER THAN FOLLOW THE FAS_HION, THAT
IS US_ED BY THE RES_T OF THE WORLD, HE WILL WEAR
DIS_S_ENTING CLOATHS WITH ODD FANTAS_TIC DEVICES
TO DIS_TINGUISH HIMS_ELF FROM OTHERS, LIKE MARKS
S_ET UPON CATTLE. HE CARES NOT WHAT PAINS HE
THROWS AWAY UPON THE MEANES_T TRIFLE, S_O IT BE
BUT S_TRANGE, WHILE S_OME PITY, AND OTHERS LAUGH
AT HIS ILL-EMPLOYED INDUS_TRY. HE IS ONE OF
THOS_E, THAT VALUED [I] EPICTETUS'S [I] LAMP ABOVE THE
EXCELLENT BOOK HE WRIT BY IT. IF HE BE A BOOK-
MAN HE S_PENDS ALL HIS TIME AND STUDY UPON
THINGS THAT ARE NEVER TO BE KNOWN. THE

He is wonderfully taken with abs_trus_e Know-

Pair of Tongs wrapt up in Mys_teries and Hiero-
glyphics, than touch it with his Hands, or s_ee
it plainly demons_trated to his Sens_es.
