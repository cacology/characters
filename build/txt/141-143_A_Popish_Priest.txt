[I]s one that takes the s_ame Cours_e, that the
IDevil (i) did in Paradis_e, he begins with the
Woman. He Des_pis_es all other (i)Fanatics (i) as Up-
s_tarts, and values hims_elf upon his Antiquity.
He is a Man-Midwife to the Soul, and is all
his Life-time in this World deluding it to the
next. (i) Christ (i) made St. (i) Peter (i) a Fis_her of Men ;
but he believe it better to be a Fis_her of Wo-
men, and s_o becomes a Woman's Apos_tle.
His Profes_s_ion is to dis_guise hims_elf, which he
does in Sheeps-Cloathing, that is, a Lay Habit ;
but whether, as a Wolf, a Thief or a Shep-
herd, is a great Question ; only this is certain,
that he had rather have one Sheep out of ano-
ther Man's Fold, that two out of his own.
He gathers his Church as (i) Fantaics do, yet des_-
pis_es them for it, and keeps his Flock always in
Hurdles, to be removed at his Pleas_ure ; and
though their Souls be rotten or s*cabby with

Hypocris_y, the Fleece is s_ure to be s_ound and
orthodox. He tars their Cons_ciences with
Confes_s_ion and Penance, but always keeps the
Wool, that he pulls from the Sore, to hims_elf.
He never makes a Pos_clyte, but he (i) converts (i)
him to his very Shirt, and (i) turns (i) his Pockets
into the Bargain ; for he does nothing unles_s
his Purs_e prove a good (i) Catholic. (i) He never gets
within a Family, but he gets on the Top of it,
and governs all down to the Bottom of the
Cellar--He will not tolerate the Scullion un-
les_s he be othrodox, nor allow of the turning
of the Spit, but (i) in ordine ad Spiritualia. (i) His
(i) Dominion is not founded in Grace, (i) but Sin ; for he
keeps his Subjects in perfect Awe by being
acquainted with their mos_t s_acred Iniquities,
as (i) Juvenal (i) s_aid of the (i) Greeks. (i)
#indent (i) Scire volunt s_ecreta domus, atque in de timeri. (i)
By this means he holds Intelligence with their
own Cons_ciences agains_t thems_elves, and keeps
their very Thoughts in Slavery ; for Men com-
monly fear thos_e that know any Evil of them,
and out of Shame give Way to them. He is
very cautious in venturing to attack any Man
by Way of Convers_ion, whos_e Weaknes_s he is
not very well acquainted with ; and like the

FOX, WEIGHS HIS GOOS_E, BEFORE HE WILL VENTURE
TO CARRY HIM OVER A RIVER. HE FIGHTS WITH THE
(I) DEVIL (I) AT HIS OWN WEAPONS, AND S_TRIVES TO GET
GROUND ON HIM WITH FRAUDS AND LIES--THES_E
HE CONVERS TO PIOUS US_ES. HE MAKES HIS
PRAYERS (THE PROPER BUS_INES_S OF THE MIND) A
KIND OF MANUFACTURE, AND VENTS THEM BY TALE,
RATHER THAN WEIGHT ; AND, WHILE HE IS BUS_IED
IN NUMBERING THEM, FORGETS THEIR SENS_E AND
MEANING. HE S_ETS THEM UP AS MEN DO THEIR
GAMES AT (I) PICQUET, (I) FOR FEAR HE S_HOULD BE MIS_-
RECKONED; BUT NEVER MINDS WHETHER HE PLAYS
FAIR OR NOT. HE S_ELLS INDULGENCES, LIKE (I) LOCKIER'S (I)
PILLS, WITH DIRECTIONS HOW THEY ARE TO BE TAKEN.
HE IS BUT A COPYHOLDER OF THE (I) CATHOLIC (I) CHURCH,
THAT CLAIMS BY CUS_TOM. HE BELIEVES THE (I) POPE'S (I)
CHAIN IS FAS_TENED TO THE GATES OF HEAVEN, LIKE
KING (I) HARRY'S (I) IN THE PRIVY-GALLERY./
