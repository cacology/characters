[I]s one, that is s_o delighted with the s_weet/ [I] Sound of his own
Tongue, that [i] William
Prynne [i] will s_ooner lend an Ear, than he, to any
Thing els_e. His Meas_ure of Talk is till his
Wind is s_pent; and then he is not s_ilenced,
but becalmed. His Ears have catched the
Itch of his Tonuge, and though he s_cratch
them, like a Deas_t with his Hoof, he finds a
Pleas_ure in it. A [i] s_ilenced Minis_ter, [i] has more
Mercy on the Government in a s_ecure Conven-
ticle, than he has on the Company, that he is
in. He s_hakes a Man by the Ear, as a Dog
does a Pig, and never loos_es his Hold, till he
has tired hims_elf, as well as his Patient. He
does not talk to a Man, but attack him, and
whoms_oever he can get into his Hands he lays
violent Language on. If he can he will run
a Man up agains_t a Wall, and hold him at a

Bay by the Buttons, which he handles as bad
as he does his Pers_on, or the Bus_ines_s he treats
upon. When he finds him begin to s_ink, he
holds him by the Cloaths, and feels him as a
Butcher does a Calf, before he kills him. He
is a walking Pillory, and crucifies more Ears
than a dozen s_tanding ones. He will hold any
Argument rather than his Tongue, and main-
tain both s_ides at his own Charge; for he will
tell you what you will s_ay, though, perhaps,
he does not intende to give you leave. He
lugs Men by the Ears, as they correct Children
in [i] Scotland, [i] and will make them tingle, while
he talks with them, as s_ome s_ay they will do,
whena Man is talked of in his Abs_ence. When
he talks to a Man, he comes up clos_e to him,
and like an old Solider lets fly in his Face, or
claps the Bore of his Pis_tol to his Ear, and
whispers aloud, that he may be s_ure not to
mis_s his Mark. His tongue is always in Mo-
tion, tho very s_eldom to the Purpos_e, like a
Barber's Scis_s_ers, which are always s_nipping,
as well when they do not cut, as when they
do. His Tongue is like a Bagpipe Drone, that
has no Stop, but makes a continual ugly Nois_e,
hims*elf. He never leaves a Man until he has

RUN HIM DOWN, AND THEN HE WINDS A DEATH
OVER HIM. A SOW-GELDER'S HORN IS NOT S_O
TERRIBLE TO DOGS AND CATS, AS HE IS TO ALL THAT
KNOW HIM. HIS WAY OF ARGUMENT IS TO TALK
ALL, AND HEAR TO CONTRADICTION. FIRS_T HE GIVES
HIS ANTAGONIS_T THE LENGTH OF THE WIND, AND
THEN, LET HIM MAKE HIS APPROACHES INF HE CAN,
HE IS S_URE TO BE BEFOREHAND WITH HIM. OF ALL
DIS_S_OLUTE DIS_EAS_ES THE RUNNING OF THE TONGUE IS
THE WORS_T, AND THE HARDES_T TO BE CURED. IF HE
HAPPEN AT ANY TIME TO BE AT A STAND, AND ANY
MAN ELS_E BEGINS TO S_PEAK, HE PRES_ENTLY DROWNS
HIM WITH HIS NOIS_E, AS A WATER-DOG MAKES A
DUCK DIVE: FOR WHEN YOU THINK HE HAS DONE
HE FALLS ONE, AND LETS FLY AGAIN, LIKE A GUN, THAT
WILL DIS_CHARGE NINE TIMES WITH ONE LOADING.
HE IS A RATTLES_NAKE, THAT WITH HIS NOIS_E GIVES
MEN WARNING TO AVOID HIM, OTHERWIS_E HE WILL
MAKE THEM WIS_H THEY HAD. HE IS, LIKE A BELL,
GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT TO MAKE A NOIS_E. HE IS
LIKE COMMON FAME, THAT S_PEAKS MOS_T AND
KNOWS LEAS_T, LORD [I] BROOKS, [I] OR A WILDGOOS_E AL-
WAYS CACKLING WHEN HE IS UPON THE WING.
HIS TONGUE IS LIKE ANY KIND OF CARRIAGE, THE
LES_S WEIGHT IT BEARS, THE FAS_TER AND EAS_IER IT
GOES. HE IS S_O FULL OF WORDS, THAT THEY RUN
OVER, AND ARE THROWN AWAY TO NO PURPOS*E; AND

put in hi runs out immediately. He is s_o
long in delivering hims_elf, that thos_e that hear
him des_ire to be delivered too, or dis_patched
out of their Pain. He makes his Dis_course the
longer with often repeating [i] to be s_hort, [i] and talks
much of [i] in fine, [i] but never means to come near
it.
