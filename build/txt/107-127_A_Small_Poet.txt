A
SMALL POET


I²S one, that would fain make himſelf that,
which _Nature_ never meant him ; like a _Fa-_
_natic_, that inſpires himſelf with his own
Whimſies. He ſets up Haberdaſher of ſmall
Poetry, with a very ſmall Stock, and no Credit.
He believes it is Invention enough to find out
other Men’s Wit ; and whatſoever he lights upon
either in Books, or Company, he makes bold
with as his own. This he puts together ſo un-
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit
has the Rickets, by the ſwelling Diſproportion
of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of
him ; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that
he has catched of others ; and his Flame like
that of Charcoals, that were burnt before :
But as he wants Judgment to underſtand what
is beſt, he naturally takes the worſt, as being
moſt agreeable to his own Talent. You may

------------------------------------------------------------------------

know his Wit not to be natural, ’tis ſo un-
quiet and troubleſome in him : For as thoſe,
that have Money but ſeldom, are always ſhak-
ing their Pockets, when they have it ; ſo does
he, when he thinks he has got ſomething, that
will make him appear. He is a perpetual Tal-
ker ; and you may know by the Freedom of his
Diſcourſe, that he came light by it, as Thieves
ſpend freely what they get. He meaſures other
Men’s Wits by _their_ Modeſty, and his own by
_his_ Confidence. He makes nothing of writing
Plays, becauſe he has not Wit enough to un-
derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-
ture to talk and ſcribble, as Chowſes do to play
with cunning Gameſters, until they are cheated
and laughed at. He is always talking of Wit,
as thoſe, that have bad Voices, are always ſing-
ing out of Tune ; and thoſe, that cannot play,
delight to fumble on Inſtruments. He grows
the unwiſer by other Men’s Harms ; for the
worſe others write, he finds the more Encou-
ragement to do ſo too. His Greedineſs of
Praiſe is ſo eager, that he ſwallows any Thing,
that comes in the Likeneſs of it, how notorious
and palpable ſoever, and is as Shot-free againſt
any Thing, that may leſſen his good Opinion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

of himſelf---This renders him incurable, like
Diſeaſes, that grow inſenſible.

If you diſlike him it is at your own Peril ;
he is ſure to put in a Caveat beforehand againſt
your Understanding ; and, like a Malefactor
in Wit, is always furniſhed with Exceptions
againſt his Judges. This puts him upon perpe-
tual Apologies, Excuſes, and Defences, but
ſtill by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-
fling Strain, without Regard of any Man,
that ſtands in the Way of his Pageant.
Where he thinks he may do it ſafely, he
will confidently own other Men’s Writings ;
and where he fears the Truth may be diſcovered,
he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inſinua-
tions give Men Occaſion to ſuppoſe ſo.

If he underſtands _Latin_ or _Greek_ he ranks
himſelf among the Learned, deſpiſes the Igno-
rant, talks Criticiſms out of _Scaliger_, and re-
peats _Martial_'s baudy Epigrams, and ſets up
his Reſt wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be
not ſo well qualified, he crys down all Learning
as pedantic, diſclaims Study, and profeſſes to
write with as great Facility, as if his Muſe was

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ſliding down _Parnaſſus_. Whatſoever he hears
well ſaid[1] he ſeizes upon by poetical Licence ;
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill
repeating of it---This he believes to be no
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others
throw away. By this means his Writings are,
like a Taylor’s Cuſhion, of moſaic Work,
made up of ſeveral Scraps ſewed together.
He calls a ſlovenly naſty Deſcription _great Na-_
_ture_, and dull Flatneſs _strange Eaſineſs_. He
writes down all that comes in his Head, and
makes no Choice, becauſe he has nothing to
do it with, that is Judgment. He is always
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like
the _long Parliament_ making _Ordinances_ in their
Stead ; although they are perpetually _thrown_
_out_ of Coffee-Houſes, and come to Nothing.
He is like an _Italian_ Thief, that never robs,
but he murthers, to prevent Diſcovery ; ſo ſure
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may paſs
unſuſpected. He is but a Copier at beſt, and
will never arrive to practice by the Life : For
bar him the Imitation of ſomething he has
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form
of juſt Wit, are above his Philoſophy. He
appears ſo over concerned in all Men’s Wits,
as if they were but Diſparagements of his
own ; and crys down all they do, as if they
were Encroachments upon him. He takes
Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them, as
_Justices_ do falſe Weights, and Pots that want
Meaſure. When he meets with any Thing,
that is very good, he changes it into ſmall
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to
ſerve ſeveral Occaſions. He diſclaims Study,
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to ſhoot
flying, which appears to be very true by his
often miſſing of his Mark. His Wit is much
troubled with Obſtructions ; and he has Fits as
painful as thoſe of the Spleen. He fancies him-
ſelf a dainty ſpruce Shepherd, with a Flock and
a fine ſilken Shepherdeſs, that follows his Pipe,
as Rats did the Conjurers in _Germany_.

As for _Epithets_, he always avoids thoſe, that
are near akin to the Senſse. Such matches are
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a _Chriſtian_
Poet ; and therefore all his Care is to chuſe out
[^2]: [_footnote cont'd from prev. page_] _Quem recitas meus eſt, O
Fidentine, libellus :_
_Sed male dum recitas, incipit eſſe tuus.    Mart. L. 1. Ep. 39._

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ſuch, as will ſerve, like a wooden Leg, to piece
out a main’d Verſe, that wants a Foot or two ;
and if they will but rhimes now and then into
the Bargain, or run upon a Letter, it is a Work
of Supererrogation.

For _Similitudes_, he likes the hardeſt and moſt
obſcure beſt : For as Ladies wear black Patches,
to make their Complexions ſeem fairer than
they are ; ſo when an Illuſtration is more ob-
ſcure than the Senſe that went before it, it muſt
of Neceſſity make it appear clearer than it
did : For Contraries are beſt ſet off with Con-
traries.

He has found out a Way to ſave the Expence
of much Wit and Senſe : For he will make
leſs than ſome have prodigally laid out upon
five or ſix Words ſerve forty or fifty Lines.
This is a thrifty Invention, and very eaſy ; and,
if it were commonly known, would much in-
creaſe the Trade of Wit, and maintain a Mul-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

titude of ſmall Poets in conſtant Employment.
He has found out a new Sort of poetical _Geor-_
_gics_, a Trick of ſowing Wit like clover-graſs
on barren Subjects, which would yield nothing
before. This is very uſeful for the Times,
wherein, ſome Men ſay, there is no Room left
for new Invention. He will take three Grains
of Wit like the Elixir, and projecting it upon
the _Iron-Age_ turn it immediately into _Gold---_
All the Buſineſs of Mankind has preſently
vaniſhed, the whole World has kept Holiday ;
there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdeſſes ;
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed
Plum-Porrige.

We read that _Virgil_ uſed to make[2] fifty or
ſixty Verſes in a Morning, and afterwards re-
duce them to ten. This was an unthrifty
Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the
Huſbandry of his own Poetry, as _Seneca_ ſays
he was in that of a Farm ;[3] for in plain _Engliſh_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine-
pence. And as ſuch Courſes brought the
_prodigal Son_ to eat with Hogs : So they did him
to feed with Horſes,[4] which were not much
better Company, and may teach us to avoid
doing the like. For certainly it is more noble
to take four or five Grains of Senſe, and, like
a Gold-Beater, hammer them into ſo many
Leaves as will fill a whole Book ; than to write
nothing but Epitomies, which many wiſe Men
believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.

When he writes, he commonly ſteers the
Senſe of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the
End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the
Tail. For when he has made one Line, which
is eaſy enough ; and has found out ſome ſturdy
hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham-
mer the Senſe upon it, like a Piece of hot Iron
upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleaſes.

There is no Art in the World ſo rich in
Terms as Poetry ; a whole Dictionary is ſcarce

------------------------------------------------------------------------

able to contain them : For there is hardly a
Pond, a Sheep-walk, or a Gravel-pit in all
_Greece_, but the antient Name of it is become
a Term of Art in Poetry. By this means ſmall
Poets have ſuch a Stock of able hard Words lying
by them, as _Dryades_, _Hamadryades_, _Aonides_, _Fauni_,
_Nymphae_, _Sylvani_, _&c_. that ſignify nothing at all ;
and ſuch a World of pedantic Terms of the
ſame Kind, as may ſerve to furniſh all the new
Inventions and _thorough-Reformations_, that can
happen between this and _Plato_’s great Year.

When he writes he never propoſes any Scope
or Purpoſe to himſelf, but gives his Genius all
Freedom : For as he, that rides abroad for his
Pleaſure, can hardly be out of his Way ; ſo he
that writes for his Pleaſure, can ſeldom be be-
ſide his Subject. It is an ungrateful Thing to
a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing---
To what Purpoſe did the Antients feign _Pegaſus_
to have Wings, if he muſt be confined to the
Road and Stages like a Pack-Horſe, or be forced
to be obedient to Hedges and Ditches? There-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

fore he has no Reſpect to Decorum and Pro-
priety of Circumſtance ; for the Regard of
Perſons, Times, and Places is a Reſtraint too
ſervile to be impoſed upon poetical Licence ;
like him that made _Plato_[5] confeſs _Juvenal_ to be
a Philoſopher, or _Perſius_, that calls the _Athe_-
_nians Quirites_.

For _Metaphors_, he uſes to chuſe the hardeſt,
and moſt far-fet that he can light upon---Theſe
are the Jewels of Eloquence, and therefore the
harder they are, the more precious they muſt
be.

He’ll take ſcant Piece of coarſe Senſe, and
ſtretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a ſcore
Rhimes, until it crack that you may ſee through
it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head. When
you ſee his Verſes hanged up in Tobacco-Shops,
you may ſay, in defiance of the Proverb, _that_
_the weakeſt does not always go to the Wall_ ; for ’tis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

well known the Lines are ſtrong enough, and
in that Senſe may juſtly take the Wall of any,
that have been written in our Language. He
ſeldom makes a Conſcience of his Rhimes ; but
will often take the Liberty to make _preach_
rhime with _Cheat_, _Vote_ with _Rogue_, and _Com_-
_mittee-Man_ with _Hang_.

He’ll make one Word of as many Joints, as
the Tin-Pudding, that a Jugler pulls out of
his Throat, and chops in again---What think
you of _glud-fum-flam-hasta-minantes ?_ Some of
the old _Latin_ Poets[6] bragged, that their Verſes
were tougher than Braſs, and harder than
Marble ; what would they have done, if they
had ſeen theſe ? Verily they would have had
more reaſon to wiſh themſelves an hundred
Throats, than they then had, to pronounce them.

There are ſome, that drive a Trade in writ-
ing in praiſe of other Writers, (like Rooks,

  _Exegi monumentum ære perennius_
  _Regalique ſitu Pyramidum altius_      _Hor_. L. 3. O. 30

------------------------------------------------------------------------

that bet on Gameſters Hands) not at all to ce- lebrate the learned
Author's Merits, as they would ſhew, but their own Wits, of which he is
but the Subjec_t. The Letchery of this Va- nity has ſpawned more Writers
than the * civil Law: * For thoſe, whoſe Modeſty muſt notorious Va-
pours imaginable. For if the Privilege of Love be allowed--* Dicere
quae* puduit, ſcribere juſſit Amor,* why ſhould it not be ſo in Self-
Love too? For if it be Wiſdom to conceal our Imperfec_tions, what is it
to diſcover our Vir- tues? It is not like, that * Nature * gave Men
great Parts upon ſuch Terms, as the * Fairies _ uſe to give Money, to
pinch and leave them if they ſpeak of it. They ſay--_Praiſe is but the
Shadow of Virtue; * and ſure that Virtue is very foolish, that is afraid
of its own Shadow.

When he writes * Anograms, * he uſes to lay the Outſides of his Verſes
even (like a Brick-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

layer) by a Line of Rhime and Acroſtic, and fill th eMiddle with
Rubbiſh--In this he imi- tates * Ben Johnson, * but in nothing elſe.

There was one, that lined a Hat-Caſe with a Paper of * Benlowſe'_s
Poetry--_ Prynne * bought it by Chance, and put a new Demi-Caſtor into
it. The firſt Time he wore it he felt only a ſinging in his Head, which
within two Days turned to a Vertigo--He was let Blood in the Ear by one
of the State-Phyſicians, and reco- vered; but before he went abroad he
writ a Poem of Rocks and Seas, in a Stile ſo proper and natural, that it
was hard to determine, which was ruggeder.

There is no Fear of Ac_tivity, nor Gambol of Wit, that ever was
performed by Man, from him that vaults on * Pegasus, * to him that
tumbles through the Hoop of an Anagram, but * Benlows * has got the
Maſtery in it, whether it be high-rope Wit, or low-rope Wit. He

has all Sorts of * Echoes, Rebus's, Chronograms,/ &c.* beſides *
Carwichets, Clenches, * and * Quibbles--_/ As for _ Altars * and *
Pyramids * in Poetry, he has/ out-done all Men that Way; for he has/
made a * Gridiron, * and a * Frying-Pan * in Verſe,/ that, beſide the
Likeneſs in Shape, the very/ Tone and Sound of the Words did perfec_tly/
repreſent the Noiſe, that is made by thoſe/ Utenſils, ſuch as the old
Poet called * ſartago lo-/ quendi. * When he was Captain, he made all/
the Furniture of his Horſe, from the Bit to/ the Crupper, in beaten
Poetry, every Verſe/ being fitted to the Proportion of the Thing,/ with
a moral Alluſion of the Senſe to the/ Thing; as the * Bridle of
Moderation, the Saddle/ of Content, * and * the Crupper of Conſtancy;*
ſo that/ the ſame Thing was both Epigram and Emblem,/ even as Mule is
both Horſe and Aſs.

Some Critics are of Opinion, that Poets/ ought to apply themselves to
the Imitation of/ * Nature, * and make a Conſcience of digreſſing/ from
her; but he is none of theſe. The an-/ tient Magicians could charm down
the Moon,/ and force Rivers back to their Springs by the/

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power of Poetry only; and the Moderns will/ undertake to turn the Inſide
of the Earh out-/ ward (like a Jugler's Pocket) and ſhake the/ Chesſ out
of it, make * Nature * ſhew Tricks like/ an Ape, and the Stars run on
Errands; but/ ſtill it is by dint of Poetry. And if Poets can/ so ſuch
noble Feats, they were unwiſe to deſ-/ cend to mean and vulgar: For
where the rareſt/ and moſt common Things are of a Price (as/ they are
all one to Poets) it argues Diſease in/ Judgement not to chuſe the most
curious. Hence/ ſome infer, that the Account they give of things/
deſerves no Regard, becauſe they never receive/ any Thing, as they find
it, into their Compo-/ ſitions, unleſs it agree both with the Meaſure/
of their own Fancis, and the Meaſure of their/ Lines, which can very
ſeldom happen: And/ therefore when they give a Character of any/ Thing
or Perſon, it does commonly bear no/ more Proportions to the Subject,
than the Fiſhes/ and Ships in a Map do to the Scale. But let/ ſuch know,
that Poets, as well as Kings, ought/ rather to conſider what is fit for
them to give,/ than others to receive; that they are fain to/ have
regard to the Exchange of Language, and/

------------------------------------------------------------------------

write high or low, according as that runs:/ For in this Age, when the
ſmallest Poet ſeldom/ goes below more then moſt, it were a Shame for/ a
grater and more noble Poet not to out-throw/ that cut a Bar.

T²here was a * Tobacco-Man, * that wrapped / _Spaniſh _ Tobacco in a
Paper of Verſes, which/ _Benlows_ had written againſt the * Pope, *
which/ by a natural Antipathy, that his Wit has to / any Thing that's
Catholic, ſpoiled the Tobacco;/ for it preſently turned Mundungus. This
Au-/ thor will take an * English * Word, and, like the/ * Frenchman, *
that ſwallowed Water and ſpit it/ out Wine, with a little Heaving and
Straining/ would turn it immediately into * Latin,* as * plun-/ derat
ille Domos_--Mille _ Hocopokiana, * and a thou-/ ſand ſuch./ / ##There
was a young Practitioner in Poetry,/ that found there was no good to be
done with-/ out a Miſtreſs: For he, that writes of Love/ before he hath
tried it, doth but travel by the/ Map; and he, that makes Love without
a/ Dame, does like a Gameſter, that plays for/ / #*More the moſt] There
is an appearance Defect or Error in theſe/ Words; but I leave it to the
Reader to ſupply or correct./

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing. He thought it convenient therefore,/ firſt to furniſh himſelf
with a Name for his/ Miſstress beforehand, that he might not be to/
ſeek, when his Merit or good Fortune ſhould/ beſtow her upon him: for
every Poet is his/ miſtreſſe's Godfather, and gives her a new/ Name,
like a Nun that takes Orders. He was/ very curious to ſit himself with a
handſome/ Word of a turnable Sound; but could light/ upon none, that
ſome Poet or other had not / made uſe of before. He was therefore
forced/ to fall to coining, and was ſeveral Months be-/ fore he could
light on one, that pleaſed him/ perfectly. But after he had overcome
that Dif-/ ficulty, he found a greater remaining, to get a/ Lady to own
him. He accoſted ſome of all/ Sorts, and gave them to underſtand, both
in/ Proſe and Verſe, how incomparably happy it/ was in his Power to make
his Miſtreſs, but/ could never convert any of them. At length/ he was
fain to make his Landreſs ſupply that/ Place as Proxy, until his good
Fortune, or/ ſomebody of better Quality would be more / kind to him,
which after a while he neither/ hoped nor cared for; for how mean Toever
her/ Condition was before, when he had once pre-/ tended to her, ſhe was
ſure to be a Nymph and/

------------------------------------------------------------------------

a Goddeſs. For what greater Honour can a/ Woman be capable of, than to
be tranſlated/ into precious Stones and Stars? No Herald in/ the World
can go higher. Beſides se found no/ Man can uſe that Freedom of
Hyperbole in the/ Character of a Perſon commonly known (as/ great Ladies
are) which we can in deſcribing/ one ſo obſcure and unknown, that nobody
can/ diſprove him. For he, that writes but one/ Sonnet upon any of the
public Perſons, ſhall/ be ſure to have his Reader at ever third Word/
cry out--What an Aſs is this to call * Spaniſh/ paper and Ceruſe Lillies
and Roſes, * or * claps In-/ fluences--* To ſay, * the Graces are her
waiting Wo-/ men, * when they are known to be no better/ than her
Bawdes--that * Day breaks from her/ Eyes, _when ſhe looks aſquint--Or
that _ her/ Breath perfumes the Arabian Winds, * when ſhe/ puffs
Tobacco?/ / ##It is no mean Art to improve a Language,/ and find out
Words, that are not only removed/ from common uſe, but rich in
Conſonanats,/ the Nerves and Sinews of Speech, to raiſe a/ / ---

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ſft and feeble Language like ours to the Pitch/ of * High-Dutch,* as he
did, that writ

  -   Arts rattling Foreſkins ſhrilling Bagpipes quell.*/

This is not the only the moſt elegant, but moſt po-/ litic Way of
Writing, that a Poet can uſe; for I/ know no Defence like it to preſerve
a Poem from/ the Torture of thoſe that liſp and ſtammer./ He that wants
Teeth may as well venture upon/ a Piece of tough horny Brawn as ſuch a
Line,/ for he will look like an Aſs eating Thiſtles.

He never begins a Work without an Invoca-/ tion of his * Muse; * for it
is not fit that ſhe ſhould/ appear in public, to ſhew her Skill before
ſhe/ is entreated, as Gentlewomen do not uſe to / ſing, until they are
applied to, and often deſired.

I ſhall not need to ſay any this of the Ex-/ cellence of Poetry, ſince
it has been already/ performed by many excellent Perſons, among/ whom
ſome have lately undertaken to prove, that/ the civil Government cannot
poſſibly ſubſiſt with-/ out it, which, for my Part, I believe to be true

-   ſome have lately. _] This alludes to _ Davenant--See * G---

------------------------------------------------------------------------

in a poetical Senſe, and more probable to be/ received of it, than thoſe
ſtrange Feats of/ building Walls and making Trees dance,/ which
Antiquity aſcribes to Verſe. And though/ * Philoſophers * are of a
contrary Opinion, and will/ not allow Poets fit to live in a
Commonwealth,/ their Partiality is plainer than their Reaſons;/ for they
have no other Way to pretend to this/ Prerogative themſelves, as they
do, but by re-/ moving Poets, whom they know to have a/ fairer Title;
and this they do unjuſtly, that/ * Plato, * who firſt baniſhed Poets his
Republic,/ forgot that the very Commonwealth was poe-/ tical. I ſhall
ſay nothing to them, but only/ deſire the World to conſider, how happily
it is/ like to be governed by thoſe, that are as ſo per-/ petual a civil
War among themſelves, that if we/ ſhould ſubmit ourſelves to their own
Reſolution/ of this Question, and be content to allow them/ only fit to
rule if they could but conclude it/ ſo themselves, they would never
agree upon it--/ Mean while there is no leſs Certainty and Agree-/ ment
in Poetry than the Mathematics; for they/ all ſubmit the to the ſame
Rules without Diſpute or/ Controverſy. But whoſoever ſhall pleaſe to
look/ into the Records of Antiquity ſhall find their/ Title ſo
unqueſtioned, that the greatest Princess

------------------------------------------------------------------------

in the whole World have been glad to derive/ their Pedigrees, and their
Power too, from/ Poets. * Alexander * the great had no wiſer a Way/ so
ſecure the Empire to himſelf by * Right, _/ which he had gotten by _
Force, * then by de-/ claring himſelf the Son of * Jupiter; * and who/
was * Jupiter * but the Son of a Poet? So * Caeſar _/ and all _ Rome *
was transported with Joy, when a/ Poet made * Jupiter * his Colleague in
the Empire;/ and when * Jupiter * governed, what did the/ Poets, that
governed Jupiter?

_Martial_'s Epigram to _Fidentinus_. [_footnote cont. next page_][^2]

[2] [_footnote for next page_] _We read that Virgil uſed to make_, &c.]
This alludes to a Paſſage
in the Life of _Virgil_ aſcribed to _Donatus_. “ Cum Georgica ſcribe-

[3] _As_ Seneca _ſays he was in that of a farm_.] _Seneca_ in his 86th
Epiſtle finds ſeveral Faults with _Virgil_'s Rules and Obſervations in
Huſbandry, as they are delivered in his _Georgics_, and adds of him ---
“ Qui non quod veriſſime, ſed quid decentiſſime diceretur, ad-

plain --- _Persius_, ſays he, commits a very great Abſurdity, when
