HUFFING COURTIER

I^2^S a Cypher, that has no Value himſelf, but\
from the Place he ſtands in.  All his Hap-\
pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others\
have of it.   This is his Faith, but as it is he-\
retical and erroneous, though he ſuffer much\
Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate, and\
not to be convinced. He flutters up and down\
like a Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is\
pruning of his Peruque takes Occaſion to con-\
template his  Legs, and the Symmetry of his\
Britches.  He is part of the Furniture of the\
Rooms, and ſerves for a walking Picture, a\
moving Piece of Arras.  His Buſineſs is only\
to be ſeen, and he performs it with admirable\
Industry, placing himself always in the beſt\
Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-\
tious whom he mixes withal. His Occupation\
is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if they could but\
walk themselves, they would ſave him the\ 


---


Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.\
His Immunity from Varlets is his Freehold,\
and he were a loſt Man without it.  His\
Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he\
gives him, for ’tis ten to one he never pays for\
them.  He is very careful to diſcover the Lining\
of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect any\
Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the\
Skin outwards.  His Taylor is his Creator,\
and makes him of nothing ; and though he\
lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_\
mitting Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells\
in the Outſide of him, like that of a hollow\
Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off him\
he deceaſes immediately.  His Carriage of\
himſelf is the wearing of his Cloaths, and,\
like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is better than\
his Body.  His looking big is rather a Tumor,\
than Greatneſs.  He is an Idol, that has juſt\
ſo much Value, as other Men give him that\
believe in him, but none of his own.  He\
makes his Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like\
a Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get\
through.  He has juſt ſo much of Politics, as\
Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have *Latin*.  He is\
as humble as a Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-\


---


pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that\
are below him ; and with a generous Scorn\
deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither do him good,\
nor hurt.  He adores thoſe, that may do him\
good, though he knows they never will ; and\
deſpiſes thoſe, that would not hurt him, if\
they could.  The Court is his Church, and he\
believes as that believes, and cries up and down\
every Thing, as he finds it paſs there.  It is a\
great Comfort to him to think, that ſome who\
do not know him may perhaps take him for a\
Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he looks\
bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-\
tance ; and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-\
times know you, and ſometimes not.  Nothing\
but want of Money or Credit puts him in\
mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts\
Providence that ſomebody will truſt him ; and\
in Expectation of that hopes for a better Life,\
and that his Debts will never riſe up in Judg-\
ment against him.  To get in debt is to labour\
in his Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his\
Protection ; for what’s that worth to one that\
owes Nothing ?  His Employment being only to\
wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his\
Life and Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers\
Books, that are his faithful Hiſtoriographers to\


---


their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes\
ſo much Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;\
and that no Man wears his Cloaths in Faſhion,\
that pays for them, for noting is further from\
the Mode.  He believes that he that runs in\
Debt is beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,\
and only thoſe, that pay, are behind.  His\
Brains are turned giddy, like one that walks\
on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon\
it is ſo troubleſome to him to look downwards.\
He is a Kind of Spectrum, and his Cloaths are\
the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ; and\
when he puts them off he vaniſhes.  He runs\
as buſily out of one Room into another, as a\
great Practiſer does in *Weſtminſter*-Hall from\
one Court to another. When he accoſts a\
Lady he puts both Ends of his Microcoſm in\
Motion, by making Legs at one End, and\
combing his Peruque at the other.  His Gar-\
niture is the Sauce to his Cloaths, and he walks\
in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in long\
Graſs.  Every Motion of him crys *Vanity of*\
*Vanities, all is Vanity,* quoth the Preacher.  He\
rides himself like a well-managed Horſe, reins\
in his Neck, and walks *Terra Terra*.  He\
carries his elbows backward, as if he were\


---


pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as\
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit.  His Legs are\
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like\
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant\
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not\
cloathed, but packt up.  His Hat has been long\
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now\
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover\
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of\
Garlick.  He wears Garniture on the Toes of\
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,\
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being\
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt.  When he\
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-\
men do their Vizard-Maſques.  His Ribbons\
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a\
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,\
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-\
rows from Reflection.  He is as tender of his\
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as\
loth to have them diſordered.  His Bravery\
is all his Happineſs ; and like *Atlas* he carries\
his Heaven on his Back.  He is like the golden\
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back.  He\
is a Monſter or an *Indian* Creature, that is\
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.\
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle\


---


in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-\
dies to play upon, who when they have done\
with him, let down his treble-String, till they\
are in the Humour again.  His Cook and Va-\
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and\
him ſo punctually together, that the one may\
not be ready before the other.  As Peacocks and\
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,\
yet cannot fly ;  ſo all his Bravery is to flutter\
only.  The Beggars call him *my Lord,* and he\
takes them at their Words, and pays them for\
it.  If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-\
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make\
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-\
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him\
when you have him.\

# AN\
ANTIQUARY

I^2^S one that has his Being in this Age, but\
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of\
old.  He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-\
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great\
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like\
the Madman, that fell in Love with *Cleopatra*.\
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has\
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten\
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm\
in his Skull.  He honours his Forefathers and\
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as\
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts.  He\
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his\
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which\
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a\
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into\
the World.  He ſpends the one half of his\
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,\


---


  and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes\
  ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does\
  it, the further they are from being new to him.\
  All his Curiouſities take place of one another\
  according to their Seniority, and he values\
  them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.\
  He has a great Veneration for Words that are\
  ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that\
  they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe\
  he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-\
  tiquity, and the good Services they have done.\
  He throws away his Time in enquiring after\
  that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,\
  like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find\
  out another that was loſt before.  He fetches\
  things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable\
  of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own\
  Aſhes.  He values one old Invention, that is\
  loſt and never to be recovered, before all the\
  new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.\
  The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with\
  his, that ſhows the Tombs at *Westminster*, only\
  the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other\
  for Money.  As every Man has but one Fa-\
  ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World\
  of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value\


---


for Things that are antient, and the further off\
the greater.

   He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time\
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,\
but is wholly retied from the preſent.  His\
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came\
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is\
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of\
them.  He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to\
any Thing that is old, that he may truly *ſay to*\
*Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-*\
*tenneſs thou are my Mother*.  He has no Provi-\
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-\
tions look backward upon the Days of old,\
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he\
walked backwards.  He had rather interpret\
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-\
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious\
new one ; and with *Scaliger* would ſell the\
Empire of *Germany*[^1] (if it were in his Power)\
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-\
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths\
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values\


[^1]:   *And with* Scaliger *would ſell the Empire of Germany*]  This al-\
ludes to a ranting Exclamation of *Scaliger*’s upon an Ode in *Horace*,\
which he was particularly pleased with.




---


it above any Thing printed, which he accounts\
but a Novelty.  When he happens to cure a\
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud\
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,\
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.\
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-\
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are\
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the\
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds\
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they\
are made up.  He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch\
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince\
out of Uſe ; as the *Catholics* allow of no Saints,\
but ſuch as are dead, and the *Fanatics*, Op-\
poſition, of none but the Living.\

#A\
PROUD MAN

I^2^S a Fool in Fermentation, that ſwells and\
boils over like a Porridge-Pot.  He ſets out\
his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem\
bigger than he is.  He is troubled with a Tu-\
mour and Inflammation of Self-Conceit, that\
renders every Part of him ſtiff and uneaſy.\
He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-\
der, that works upon him to Dotage, and has\
transformed him into his own Miſtreſs.  He\
is his own Gallant, and makes moſt paſſionate\
Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections.  He\
commits Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips\
his own Image ; though there is no Soul living\
of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes as\
the Church believes, and maintains his Faith\
with the Obſtinacy of a *Fanatic.*  He is his own\
Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above\
his Merit, but all Mankind ; is both *Damon*\
and *Pythias* to his own dear ſelf, and values his\

Crony above his Soul.  He gives Place to no\
Man but himſelf, and that with very great\
Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems not\
worthy to approach him.  He believes what-\
ſoever he has receives a Value in being his ;\
as a Horſe in a Nobleman’s Stable will bear a\
greater Price than in a common Market.  He\
is ſo proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted\
with himſelf as with others ; for he is very\
apt to forget who he is, and knows himſelf\
only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats himſelf\
civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and Com-\
pliment, but admits of no Privacy.  He ſtrives\
to look bigger than himſelf, as well as others,\
and is no better than his own Paraſite and\
Flatterer.  A little Flood will make a ſhallow\
Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and\
foam, and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep\
ſilent Stream glides quietly on.  So a vain-\
glorious inſolent proud Man ſwells with a little\
frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-\
flows his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves\
Mud and Dirt behind him.  His Carriage is\
as glorious and haughty, as if he were advan-\
ced upon Men’s Shoulders, or tumbled over\
their Heads like Knipperdolling.  He fancies\ 


---


himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head\
holds no Proportion to his Body, and his foun-\
dation is leſſer than his upper Stories.  We\
can naturally take no view of our ſelves, un-\
leſs we look downwards, to teach us how\
humble Admirers we ought to be of our own\
Values.  The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his Mate-\
rials are, the more Room they take up, and\
make him ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and\
Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions better than Things\
of more cloſe and ſolid Parts.\

#A\
FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN

I^2^S one, that is not contented to be a Privy-\
Counſellor of the Kingdom of Heaven, but\
would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,\
and tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the\
Kingdom of Earth.  His Deſign is to make\
*Chriſt* King, as his Forefathers the *Jew* did,\
only to abuſe and crucify him, that he might\
ſhare his Lands and Goods, as he did his Vice-\
gerents here.  He dreams of a Fool's Paradiſe\
without a Serpent in it, a golden Age all of\
Saints, and no Hypocrites, all *holy-Court* Princes,\
and no Subjects but the Wicked ;  a Govern-\
ment of *Perkin Warbec* and *Lambert Simnel*\
Saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it,\
might make himſelf a Price, and claim a\
Title to the Crown.  He fancies a *fifth-Mo-*\
*narchy* as the Quinteſſence of all Governments,\
abſtracted from all Matter, and conſiſting\


---


wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and Myſteries.\
*John* of *Leyden* was the firſt Founder of it, and\
though he miſcarried, like *Romulus* in a Tem-\
peſt, his Poſterity have Revelations every full\
Moon, that there may be a Time to ſet up his\
Title again, and with better Succeſs ; though\
his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had\
no ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,\
but their whole outward Men were ſet on the\
Gates of the City ; where a Head and four\
Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of the\
*fifth-Monarchy.* They have been contriving (ſince\
Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-\
ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed King\
*Oberon,* to erect their Monarchy in *Fairy-Land,*\
as being the moſt proper and natural Region in\
the whole World for their Government, and if\
it ſucceed there to proceed further.  The *De-*\
*vil's* Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,\
and the Glory of them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,\
that they would venture their Necks to take\
him at his Word, and give him his Price.\
Nothing comes ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-\
neſs as the *fifth-Monarchy,* that is no where to\
be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-\
thologies, and myſtical Riddles, like the Vi-\
ſions *Aeneas* ſaw in Hell of the *Roman* Empire.\


---


Next this it moſt reſembles *Mahomet*’s Coming\
to the *Turks,* and King *Arthur*’s Reign over the\
Britons in *Merlin*’s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin\
are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern\
the ſame Lineaments in them all.  The poor\
Wicked are like to have a very ill time under\
them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-\
vernment, according to their ancient and fun-\
damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects\
but Slaves, who between them and the *Devil*\
are like to ſuffer Perſecution enough to make\
them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-\
ters.  He gathers Churches on the Sunday, as\
the *Jews* did Sticks on their Sabbath, to ſet the\
State on Fire.  He humms and hahs high Trea-\
ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the\
Caſt they would throw.  He groans Sedition,\
and, like the *Phariſee,* rails, when he gives\
Thanks.  He interprets Propheſies, as *Whitting-\
ton* did the Bells, to ſpeak to him, and governs\
himſelf accordingly.\

# A\
MELANCHOLY MAN

I^2^s one, that keeps the worſt Company in the\
World, that is, his own; and tho' he be al-\
ways falling out and quarrelling with himſelf,\
yet he has not power to endure any other Con-\
verſation. His Head is haunted, like a Houſe,\
with evil Spirits and Apparitions, that terrify\
and fright him out of himſelf, till he ſtands\
empty and forſaken. His Sleeps and his Wa-\
kings are ſo much the ſame, that he knows not\
how to diſtinguiſh them, and many times\
when he dreams, he believes he is broad awake\
and ſees Viſions. The Fumes and Vapours\
that riſe from his Spleen and Hypocondries\
have ſo ſmutched and ſullied his Brain (like a\
Room that ſmoaks) that his Underſtanding is\
blear-ey'd, and has no right Perception of any\
Thing. His Soul lives in his Body, like a\
Mole in the Earth, that labours in the Dark,\
and caſts up Doubts and Scruples of his own


---


Imagination, to make that rugged and uneaſy,\
that was plain and open before. His Brain is\
ſo cracked, that he fancies himſelf to be Glaſs,\
and is afraid that every Thing he comes near\
ſhould break him in Pieces. Whatſoever makes\
an Impreſſion in his Imagination works it ſelf\
in like a Screw, and the more he turns and\
winds it, the deeper it ſticks, till it is never to\
be got out again. The Temper of his Brain\
being earthy, cold, and dry, is apt to breed\
Worms, that ſink ſo deep into it, no Medicine\
in Art or Nature is able to reach them. He\
leads his Life, as one leads a Dog in a Slip\
that will not follow, but is dragged along until\
he is almoſt hanged, as he has it often under\
Conſideration to treat himſelf in convenient\
Time and Place, if he can but catch himſelf\
alone. After a long and mortal Feud between\
his inward and his outward Man, they at\
length agree to meet without Seconds, and decide the\
Quarrel, in which the one drops, and the\
other ſinks out fo the Way, and makes his\
Eſcape into ſome foreign World, from whence\
is it never after heard of. He converſes with\
nothing ſo much as his own Imagination,\
which being apt to miſrepreſent Things to him,


---


makes him believe, that it is ſomething elſe\
than it is, and that he holds Intelligence with\
Spirits, that reveal whatſoever he fancies to\
him, as the antient rude People, that firſt heard\
their own Voices repeated by Echoes in the\
Woods, concluded it muſt proceed from ſome\
invisible Inhabitants of thoſe ſolitary Places,\
which they after believed to be Gods, and\
called them *Sylvans, Fauns,* and *Dryads.* He\
makes the Infirmity of his Temper paſs for\
Revelations, as *Mahomet* did by his falling\
Sickneſs, and inſpires himſelf with the Wind\
of his own Hypocondries. He laments, like\
*Heraclitus* the Maudlin Philoſopher, at other\
Men's Mirth, and take Pleaſures in nothing\
but his own un-ſober Sadneſs. His Mind is\
full of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like\
a Neſt of Boxes. He ſleeps little, but dreams\
much, and ſoundeſt when he is waking. He\
ſees Viſions further off than a ſecond-ſighted\
Man in *Scotland,* and dreams upon a hard\
Point with admirable Judgement. He is juſt\
ſo much worſe than a Madman, as he is below\
him in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen\
the moſt mad govern all the reſt, and receive\
a natural Obedience from their Inferiors.

for if that, which is wickedly gotten, may

Shot-free againſt all the Attempts of the *Devil,*

and encounter them at their own Weapons.

Power, becauſe he would have no Body uſe it\
but himſelf.  If he have Hope of Preferment\
he makes all the Law run on the King's Side ;\
if not, it always takes part againſt him ; for as\
he was bred to make any Thing right or wrong\
between Man and Man, ſo he can do between\
the King and his Subjects.  He calls himſelf\
*Capitalis, &c.* which Word he never uſes but\
to Crimes of the higeſt Nature. He uſurps\
unſufferable Tyranny over Words ; for when\
he has enſlaved and debaſed them from their\
original Senſe, he makes them ſerves againſt\
themselves to ſupport him, and their own\
Abuſe. He is as ſtiff to Delinquents, and\
makes as harſh a Noiſe as a new Cart-wheel,\
until he is greaſed, and then he turns about as\
eaſily.  He called all necceſſary and unavoidable\
Proceedings of State, without the punctual\
Formality of Law, arbitrary and illegal, but\
never conſiders, that his own Interpretation\


---


of Law are more arbitrary, and, when he\
pleaſes, illegal.  He cannot be denied to be a\
very impartial Judge ; for right or wrong\
are all one to him.  He takes Bribes, as pious\
Men give Alms, with ſo much Caution, that\
his right Hand never knows what his left re-\
ceives./

#AMORIST/
/
I^2^s an Artificer, or Maker of Love, a ſworn/
Servant to all Ladies, like an Officer in a/
Corporation. Though no one in particular/
will own any Title to him, yet he never fails,/
upon all Occaſions, to offer his Services, and/
they as ſeldom to turn it back again untouched./
He commits nothing with them, but himſelf to/
their good Graces ; and they recommend him/
back again to his own, where he finds ſo kind/
a Reception, that he wonders how he does/
fail of it every where elſe.  His Paſſion is as/
eaſily ſet on Fire as a Fart, and as ſoon out/

Powder like a Gun, and the leaſt Sparkle of an/
Eye gives Fire to him, and off he goes, but/
ſeldom, or never, hits the Mark.  He has com-/
mon Places and Precedents of Repartees and/
Letters for all Occaſions ; and falls as readily/
into his Method of making love, as a Parſon/

does into his Form of Matrimony. He con-
verſes, as Angels are ſaid to do, by Intuition,
and expreſſes himſelf by Sighs moſt ſignificant-

Buſineſs, and is very induſtrious in waiting on
the Ladies, where his Affairs lie ; among which
thoſe of greateſt Concernment are *Queſtions and
Commands, Purpoſes,* and other ſuch received
Forms of With and Converſation ; in which he
is ſo deeply ſtudied, that in all Queſtions and
Doubts that ariſe, he is appealed to, and very
learnedly declares, which was the moſt true and
primitive Way of proceeding in the pureſt
Times. For theſe Virtues he never fails of his
Summons to all Balls, where he manages the
Country-Dances with ſingular Judgment, and
is frequently an Aſſiſtant at L'hombre; and theſe
are all the Uſes they make of his Parts, beſide
the Sport they give themſelves in laughing at
him, which he takes for ſingular Favours, and
interprets to his own Advantage, though it
never goes further; for all his Employments
being public, he is never admitted to any pri-
vate Services, and they deſpiſe him as not Wo-
man's Meat: For he applies to too many to be
truſted by any one; as Baſtards by having
many Fathers, have none at all. He goes often

mounted in a Coach as a Convoy, to guard the\
Ladies, to take the Duſt in *Hyde-Park*; where\
by his prudent Management of the Glaſs Win-\
dows he ſecures them from Beggars, and re-\

Thus he is but a Gentleman-Uſher General,\

He packs his\Quibbles like a Stock of Cards, let him but\ſhuffle, and cut where you will, he will be\ſure to have it.  He dances on a Rope of Sand,\does the *Somerſet*, *Strapado*, and half-ſlrapado\with Words, plays at all manner of Games\

with *Clinches*, *Carwickets*, and *Quibbles*, and\talks *under-Leg*. His Wit is left-handed, and\therefore what others mean for right, he ap-\prehends quite contrary.

He\rings the Changes upon Words, and is ſo ex-\pert, that he can tell at firſt Sight, how\many Variations any Number of Words will\bear. He talks with a *Trillo*, and gives his\Words a double Reliſh. He had rather have\them bear two Senſes in vain and impertinent-\ly, than one to the Purpoſe, and never ſpeaks\without a Lere-Senſe. He talks nothing but\Equivocation and mental Reſervation, and\mightily affects to give a Word a double Stroke, \like a Tennis-Ball againſt two Walls at one\Blow, to defeat the Expectation of his An-\tagonift.

[*two rules*]#An\Impudent Man^I^s one, whoſe want of Money and want of\Wit have engaged him beyond his Abilities.\The little Knowledge he has of himſelf being\ſuitable to the little he has in his Profeſſion has\Made him believe himſelf fit for it. This double\Ignorance has made him ſet a Value upon him-\ſelf, as he that wants a great deal appears in a\better Condition, than he that wants a little.\This renders him confident, and fit for any\Undertaking, and ſometimes (ſuch is the con-\current Ignorance of the World) he proſpers\In it, but oftner miſcarries, and becomes ri-\diculous; yet this Advantage he has, that as\nothing can make him ſee his Error, ſo he is\fortified with his Ignorance, as barren and\rocky Places are by their Situation, and he will\rather believe that all Men want Judgment,\

---


than himſelf. For as no Man is pleaſed, that\has an ill Opinion of himſelſ, Nature, that\finds out Remedies herſelf, and his own Eaſe\render him indefenſible of his Defects¬—From\hence he grows impudent; for as Men judge\by Compariſon, he knows as little what it is\To be defective, as what it is to be excellent.\Nothing renders Men modeſt, but a juſt Know-\ledge how to compare themſelves with others;\and where that is wanting, Impudence supplies\the Place of it: for there is no Vacuum in the\Minds of Men, and commonly, like other\Things in Nature, they ſwell more with Rare-\faction than Condenſation. The more Men\know of the World, the worſe Opinion they\have of it; and the more they underſtand of\Truth, they are better acquainted with the\Difficulties of it, and conſsequently are the leſs\confident in their Aſſertions, eſpecially in mat-\ters of Probability, which commonly is ſquint-\ey’d, and looks nine Ways at once. It is the\Office of a juſt Judge to hear both Parties, and\he that conſiders but the one Side of Things\can never make a juſt Judgment, though he\may by Chance a true one. Impudence is the\Baſtard of Ignorance, not only unlawfully,\


---


but inceſtouſsly begotten by a Man upon his\own Underſtanding, and laid by himſelſ at\his own Door, a Monſter of unnatural Pro-\duction; for Shame is as much the Propriety\of human Nature (though overſeen by the\Philoſsophers) and perhaps more than Reaſon,\Laughing, or looking aſquint, by which they\diſtinguish Man from Beaſts; and the leſs\Men have of it, the nearer they approach to\the Nature of Brutes. Modeſty is but a noble\Jealouſy of Honour, and Impudence the Proſ-\titution of it; for he, whoſe Face is proof\againſt Infamy, muſt be as little ſenſible of\Glory. His Forehead, like a voluntary Cuck-\old’s is by his Horns made Proof againſt a\Bluſh. Nature made Man barefaced, and civil\Cuſtom has preſerved him ſo; but he that’s im-\pudent does wear a Vizard more ugly and de-\formed than Highway Thieves diſguiſe them-\ſelves with. Shame is the tender moral Con-\ſcience of good Men. When there is a Crack\In the Skull, Nature herſelf with a tough horny\Callus repairs the Breach; ſo a flaw’d Intellect\ is with a brawny Callus Face ſupplied. The\Face is the Dial of the Mind; and where they\Do not go together, ‘tis a Sign, that one or\Both are out of Order. He that is impudent\

is like a Merchant, that trades upon his Cre-\dit without a Stock, and if his Debts were\known, would break immediately.

Religion is but the cold Fit of an Ague, and his\
Zeal of a contrary Temper to that of all others,\

has a Crack in his Skull by the flat Twang of\

Doctrine to be heavenly, becauſe it agrees per-\

Hopes are in the *Turks* overrunning of Chriſ-\
tendom, becauſe he has heard they count Fools\
and Madmen Saints, and doubts not to paſs\
muſter with them for great Abilities that Way.\
This makes him believe he can convert the *Turk*,\

*Preſbyterian*.  Nothing comes ſo near his quak-\

*Devil*, with which it conforms in Diſcipline\

found without great Inequalities.  Next De_\

turned Preacher, becauſe he held it ſuperſtiti-\

Kind of ſpiritual Palſy, that proceeds from a\

for that abates his Meaſure, for he thinks it\
a greater Sin to commit Murder for ſmall\
Gains, than a valuable Conſideration.  He\
does not only ſpoil and deſtroy his Wines, but\
an ancient reverend Proverb, with brewing and\
racking, that ſays, *In vino veritas*, for there\
is no Truth in his, but all falſe and ſophiſtica-\
ted ; for he can counterfeit Wine as cunningly\
as *Apelles* did Grapes, and cheat Men with it,\
as *he* did Birds.  He brings every Bottle of\
Wine he draws to the *Bar*, to confeſs it to be\
a Cheat, and afterwards puts himſelf upon\
the Mercy of the Company.  He is an *Anti-*\
*chriſtian* Cheat ; for Chriſt turned Water into\
Wine, and he turns Wine into Water.  He\
ſcores all his Reckonings upon two Tables\
made like thoſe of the ten Commandments, that\
he may be put in Mind to break them as oft as\
poſſibly he can ; eſpecially that of ſtealing and\
bearing falſe Witneſs againſt his Neighbour,\
when he draws him bad Wine and ſwears it is\
good, and that he can take more for the Pipe\
than the Wine will yield him by the Bottle,\
a Trick that a *Jesuit* taught him to cheat his\

over-reckon notoriouſly, he has one common\
Evaſion for all, and that is to ſay it was a\
Miſtake, by which he means, that he thought\
they had not been ſober enough to diſcover it ;\
for if it had paſt, there had been no Error at\
all in the Caſe.\

#A\
LOVER

I^2^S a Kind of *Goth* and *Vandal*, that leaves\
his native Self to ſettle in another, or a\
Planter that forſakes his Country, where he\
was born, to labour and dig in *Virginia*.\
His Heart is catched in a Net with a Pair of\
bringht ſhining Eyes, as Larks are with Pieces\
of a looking-Glaſs.  He makes heavy Com_\
plaints againſt it for deſerting of him, and\
deſires to have another in Exchange for it,\
which is a very unreaſonable Requeſt ; for if\
it betrayed its boſom Friend, what will it do\
to a Stranger, that ſhould give it Truſt and\
Entertainment ?  He binds himſelf, and cries\
out he is robbed of his Heart, and charges the\
Innocent with it, only to get a good Com-\
poſition, or another for it, againſt Con-\
ſcience and Honeſty.  He talks much of his\


---


Flame, and pretends to be burnt by his Miſ-\
treſs’s Eyes, for which he requires Satisfaction\
from her, like one that ſets his Houſe on Fire\
to get a Brief for charitable Contributions.\
He makes his Miſtreſs all of Stars, and when\
ſhe is unkind, rails at them, as if they did ill\
Offices between them, and being of her Kin\
ſet her againſt him.  He falls in Love as Men\
fall ſick when their Bodies are inclined to it,\
and imputes that to his Miſtreſſes Charms,\
which is really in his own Temper ; for when\
that is altered, the other vaniſhes of it ſelf, and\
therefore one ſaid not amiſs,

------The Lilly and the Roſe\
Not in her Cheeks, but in thy Temper grows.

When his Deſires are grown up, they ſwarm,\
and fly out to ſeek a new Habitation, and\
whereſoever they light they fix like Bees, among\
which ſome late Philoſophers have obſerved\
that it is a Female that leads all the reſt.  Love\
is but a Clap of the Mind, a Kind of run-\
ning of the Fancy, that breaks out, if it be\
not ſtopped in Time, into Botches of heroic\
Rime ; for all Loverrs are poets for the Time\

being, and make their Ladies a Kind of mo-\
ſaic Work of ſeveral coloured Stones joined\
together by a ſtrong Fancy, but very ſtiff and\
unnatural ; and though they ſteal Stars from\
Heaven, as *Prometheus* did Fire, to animate\
them, all will not make them alive, nor\
alives-liking.\
