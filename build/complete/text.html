<h1 id="preface.">PREFACE.</h1>
<p><em>T<sup>2</sup>HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit</em><br />
<em>much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt</em><br />
<em>Century. The two principal Authors in this Way</em><br />
<em>were Sir</em> Thomas Overbury, <em>and Dr.</em> John<br />
Earle <em>Tutor to Prince</em> Charles <em>in</em> 1643, <em>and after</em><br />
<em>the Reſtoration Dean of</em> Weſtminſter, <em>and ſuc-</em><br />
<em>ceſſively Biſhop of</em> Worceſter <em>and</em> Saliſbury. <em>How</em><br />
<em>agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public</em><br />
<em>Taſte may be judged from Sir</em> Thomas’s <em>little Book</em><br />
<em>having fourteen Editions before</em> 1632, <em>and the</em><br />
<em>Biſhop’s ſix between</em> 1628 <em>and</em> 1633. <em>Whether</em><br />
Butler <em>has equalled or excelled them, and what</em><br />
<em>Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt</em><br />
<em>be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-</em><br />
<em>reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me</em><br />
<em>a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge. The Reader</em><br />
<em>will have an Opportunity of determining for him-</em><br />
<em>ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame</em><br />
<em>Pictures.</em><br />
[<em>a test to see if it deploys</em>]</p>
<hr />
<p><em>As in ſuch a Variety of Characters there muſt</em><br />
<em>be ſome drawn from Originals in general the ſame,</em><br />
<em>and only differenced by particular Circumſtances,</em><br />
<em>the ſame Obſervations are ſometimes repeated.</em><br />
<em>Whether the Author in this Caſe requires any Apo-</em><br />
<em>logy muſt be left to his Judges the Critics ; it is</em><br />
<em>enough for me that I can ſay I have done him</em><br />
<em>Justice in publiſhing them.</em></p>
<p><em>As moſt of theſe Characters are dated when they</em><br />
<em>were compoſed, I can inform the curious, that they</em><br />
<em>were chiefly drawn up from</em> 1667 <em>to</em> 1669, <em>at</em><br />
<em>which time, as has been before obſerved,</em> Butler<br />
<em>reſided in</em> Wales <em>under the Protection of Lord</em><br />
Carbery.<br />

HUFFING COURTIER</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S a Cypher, that has no Value himſelf, but<br />
from the Place he ſtands in. All his Hap-<br />
pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others<br />
have of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-<br />
retical and erroneous, though he ſuffer much<br />
Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate, and<br />
not to be convinced. He flutters up and down<br />
like a Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is<br />
pruning of his Peruque takes Occaſion to con-<br />
template his Legs, and the Symmetry of his<br />
Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the<br />
Rooms, and ſerves for a walking Picture, a<br />
moving Piece of Arras. His Buſineſs is only<br />
to be ſeen, and he performs it with admirable<br />
Industry, placing himself always in the beſt<br />
Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-<br />
tious whom he mixes withal. His Occupation<br />
is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if they could but<br />
walk themselves, they would ſave him the </p>
<hr />
<p>Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.<br />
His Immunity from Varlets is his Freehold,<br />
and he were a loſt Man without it. His<br />
Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he<br />
gives him, for ’tis ten to one he never pays for<br />
them. He is very careful to diſcover the Lining<br />
of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect any<br />
Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the<br />
Skin outwards. His Taylor is his Creator,<br />
and makes him of nothing ; and though he<br />
lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_<br />
mitting Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells<br />
in the Outſide of him, like that of a hollow<br />
Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off him<br />
he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of<br />
himſelf is the wearing of his Cloaths, and,<br />
like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is better than<br />
his Body. His looking big is rather a Tumor,<br />
than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt<br />
ſo much Value, as other Men give him that<br />
believe in him, but none of his own. He<br />
makes him Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like<br />
a Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get<br />
through. He has juſt ſo much of Politics, as<br />
Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have <em>Latin</em>. He is<br />
as humble as a Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that<br />
are below him ; and with a generous Scorn<br />
deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither do him good,<br />
nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do him<br />
good, though he knows they never will ; and<br />
deſpiſes thoſe, that would not hurt him, if<br />
they could. The Court is his Church, and he<br />
believes as that believes, and cries up and down<br />
every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a<br />
great Comfort to him to think, that ſome who<br />
do not know him may perhaps take him for a<br />
Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he looks<br />
bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-<br />
tance ; and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-<br />
times know you, and ſometimes not. Nothing<br />
but want of Money or Credit puts him in<br />
mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts<br />
Providence that ſomebody will truſt him ; and<br />
in Expectation of that hopes for a better Life,<br />
and that his Debts will never riſe up in Judg-<br />
ment against him. To get in debt is to labour<br />
in his Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his<br />
Protection ; for what’s that worth to one that<br />
owes Nothing ? His Employment being only to<br />
wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his<br />
Life and Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers<br />
Books, that are his faithful Hiſtoriographers to<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes<br />
ſo much Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;<br />
and that no Man wears his Cloaths in Faſhion,<br />
that pays for them, for noting is further from<br />
the Mode. He believes that he that runs in<br />
Debt is beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,<br />
and only thoſe, that pay, are behind. His<br />
Brains are turned giddy, like one that walks<br />
on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon<br />
it is ſo troubleſome to him to look downwards.<br />
He is a Kind of Spectrum, and his Cloaths are<br />
the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ; and<br />
when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs<br />
as buſily out of one Room into another, as a<br />
great Practiſer does in <em>Weſtminſter</em>-Hall from<br />
one Court to another. When he accoſts a<br />
Lady he puts both Ends of his Microcoſm in<br />
Motion, by making Legs at one End, and<br />
combing his Peruque at the other. His Gar-<br />
niture is the Sauce to his Cloaths, and he walks<br />
in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in long<br />
Graſs. Every Motion of him crys <em>Vanity of</em><br />
<em>Vanities, all is Vanity,</em> quoth the Preacher. He<br />
rides himself like a well-managed Horſe, reins<br />
in his Neck, and walks <em>Terra Terra</em>. He<br />
carries his elbows backward, as if he were<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as<br />
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit. His Legs are<br />
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like<br />
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant<br />
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not<br />
cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long<br />
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now<br />
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover<br />
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of<br />
Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of<br />
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,<br />
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being<br />
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When he<br />
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-<br />
men do their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons<br />
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a<br />
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,<br />
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-<br />
rows from Reflection. He is as tender of his<br />
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as<br />
loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery<br />
is all his Happineſs ; and like <em>Atlas</em> he carries<br />
his Heaven on his Back. He is like the golden<br />
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He<br />
is a Monſter or an <em>Indian</em> Creature, that is<br />
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.<br />
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-<br />
dies to play upon, who when they have done<br />
with him, let down his treble-String, till they<br />
are in the Humour again. His Cook and Va-<br />
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and<br />
him ſo punctually together, that the one may<br />
not be ready before the other. As Peacocks and<br />
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,<br />
yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to flutter<br />
only. The Beggars call him <em>my Lord,</em> and he<br />
takes them at their Words, and pays them for<br />
it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-<br />
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make<br />
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-<br />
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him<br />
when you have him.<br />

<p>[<em>double rule</em>]</p>
<h1 id="an-antiquary">AN<br />
ANTIQUARY</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S one that has his Being in this Age, but<br />
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of<br />
old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-<br />
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great<br />
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like<br />
the Madman, that fell in Love with <em>Cleopatra</em>.<br />
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has<br />
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten<br />
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm<br />
in his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and<br />
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as<br />
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts. He<br />
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his<br />
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which<br />
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a<br />
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into<br />
the World. He ſpends the one half of his<br />
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes<br />
ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does<br />
it, the further they are from being new to him.<br />
All his Curiouſities take place of one another<br />
according to their Seniority, and he values<br />
them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.<br />
He has a great Veneration for Words that are<br />
ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that<br />
they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe<br />
he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-<br />
tiquity, and the good Services they have done.<br />
He throws away his Time in enquiring after<br />
that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,<br />
like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find<br />
out another that was loſt before. He fetches<br />
things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable<br />
of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own<br />
Aſhes. He values one old Invention, that is<br />
loſt and never to be recovered, before all the<br />
new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.<br />
The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with<br />
his, that ſhows the Tombs at <em>Westminster</em>, only<br />
the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other<br />
for Money. As every Man has but one Fa-<br />
ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World<br />
of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>for Things that are antient, and the further off<br />
the greater.</p>
<p>He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time<br />
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,<br />
but is wholly retied from the preſent. His<br />
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came<br />
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is<br />
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of<br />
them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to<br />
any Thing that is old, that he may truly <em>ſay to</em><br />
<em>Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-</em><br />
<em>tenneſs thou are my Mother</em>. He has no Provi-<br />
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-<br />
tions look backward upon the Days of old,<br />
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he<br />
walked backwards. He had rather interpret<br />
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-<br />
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious<br />
new one ; and with <em>Scaliger</em> would ſell the<br />
Empire of <em>Germany</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (if it were in his Power)<br />
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-<br />
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths<br />
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>it above any Thing printed, which he accounts<br />
but a Novelty. When he happens to cure a<br />
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud<br />
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,<br />
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.<br />
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-<br />
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are<br />
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the<br />
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds<br />
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they<br />
are made up. He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch<br />
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince<br />
out of Uſe ; as the <em>Catholics</em> allow of no Saints,<br />
but ſuch as are dead, and the <em>Fanatics</em>, Op-<br />
poſition, of none but the Living.<br />
</p>

<h1 id="a-proud-man">A<br />
PROUD MAN</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S a Fool in Fermentation, that ſwells and<br />
boils over like a Porridge-Pot. He ſets out<br />
his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem<br />
bigger than he is. He is troubled with a Tu-<br />
mour and Inflammation of Self-Conceit, that<br />
renders every Part of him ſtiff and uneaſy.<br />
He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-<br />
der, that works upon him to Dotage, and has<br />
transformed him into his own Miſtreſs. He<br />
is his own Gallant, and makes moſt paſſionate<br />
Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections. He<br />
commits Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips<br />
his own Image ; though there is no Soul living<br />
of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes as<br />
the Church believes, and maintains his Faith<br />
with the Obſtinacy of a <em>Fanatic.</em> He is his own<br />
Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above<br />
his Merit, but all Mankind ; is both <em>Damon</em><br />
and <em>Pythias</em> to his own dear ſelf, and values his<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Crony above his Soul. He gives Place to no<br />
Man but himſelf, and that with very great<br />
Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems not<br />
worthy to approach him. He believes what-<br />
ſoever he has receives a Value in being his ;<br />
as a Horſe in a Nobleman’s Stable will bear a<br />
greater Price than in a common Market. He<br />
is ſo proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted<br />
with himſelf as with others ; for he is very<br />
apt to forget who he is, and knows himſelf<br />
only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats himſelf<br />
civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and Com-<br />
pliment, but admits of no Privacy. He ſtrives<br />
to look bigger than himſelf, as well as others,<br />
and is no better than his own Paraſite and<br />
Flatterer. A little Flood will make a ſhallow<br />
Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and<br />
foam, and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep<br />
ſilent Stream glides quietly on. So a vain-<br />
glorious inſolent proud Man ſwells with a little<br />
frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-<br />
flows his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves<br />
Mud and Dirt behind him. His Carriage is<br />
as glorious and haughty, as if he were advan-<br />
ced upon Men’s Shoulders, or tumbled over<br />
their Heads like Knipperdolling. He fancies </p>
<hr />
<p>himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head<br />
holds no Proportion to his Body, and his foun-<br />
dation is leſſer than his upper Stories. We<br />
can naturally take no view of our ſelves, un-<br />
leſs we look downwards, to teach us how<br />
humble Admirers we ought to be of our own<br />
Values. The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his Mate-<br />
rials are, the more Room they take up, and<br />
make him ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and<br />
Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions better than Things<br />
of more cloſe and ſolid Parts.<br />

FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S one, that is not contented to be a Privy-<br />
Counſellor of the Kingdom of Heaven, but<br />
would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,<br />
and tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the<br />
Kingdom of Earth. His Deſign is to make<br />
<em>Chriſt</em> King, as his Forefathers the <em>Jew</em> did,<br />
only to abuſe and crucify him, that he might<br />
ſhare his Lands and Goods, as he did his Vice-<br />
gerents here. He dreams of a Fool's Paradiſe<br />
without a Serpent in it, a golden Age all of<br />
Saints, and no Hypocrites, all <em>holy-Court</em> Princes,<br />
and no Subjects but the Wicked ; a Govern-<br />
ment of <em>Perkin Warbec</em> and <em>Lambert Simnel</em><br />
Saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it,<br />
might make himſelf a Price, and claim a<br />
Title to the Crown. He fancies a <em>fifth-Mo-</em><br />
<em>narchy</em> as the Quinteſſence of all Governments,<br />
abſtracted from all Matter, and conſiſting<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and Myſteries.<br />
<em>John</em> of <em>Leyden</em> was the firſt Founder of it, and<br />
though he miſcarried, like <em>Romulus</em> in a Tem-<br />
peſt, his Poſterity have Revelations every full<br />
Moon, that there may be a Time to ſet up his<br />
Title again, and with better Succeſs ; though<br />
his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had<br />
no ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,<br />
but their whole outward Men were ſet on the<br />
Gates of the City ; where a Head and four<br />
Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of the<br />
<em>fifth-Monarchy.</em> They have been contriving (ſince<br />
Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-<br />
ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed King<br />
<em>Oberon,</em> to erect their Monarchy in <em>Fairy-Land,</em><br />
as being the moſt proper and natural Region in<br />
the whole World for their Government, and if<br />
it ſucceed there to proceed further. The <em>De-</em><br />
<em>vil's</em> Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,<br />
and the Glory of them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,<br />
that they would venture their Necks to take<br />
him at his Word, and give him his Price.<br />
Nothing comes ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-<br />
neſs as the <em>fifth-Monarchy,</em> that is no where to<br />
be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-<br />
thologies, and myſtical Riddles, like the Vi-<br />
ſions <em>Aeneas</em> ſaw in Hell of the <em>Roman</em> Empire.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Next this it moſt reſembles <em>Mahomet</em>’s Coming<br />
to the <em>Turks,</em> and King <em>Arthur</em>’s Reign over the<br />
Britons in <em>Merlin</em>’s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin<br />
are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern<br />
the ſame Lineaments in them all. The poor<br />
Wicked are like to have a very ill time under<br />
them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-<br />
vernment, according to their ancient and fun-<br />
damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects<br />
but Slaves, who between them and the <em>Devil</em><br />
are like to ſuffer Perſecution enough to make<br />
them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-<br />
ters. He gathers Churches on the Sunday, as<br />
the <em>Jews</em> did Sticks on their Sabbath, to ſet the<br />
State on Fire. He humms and hahs high Trea-<br />
ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the<br />
Caſt they would throw. He groans Sedition,<br />
and, like the <em>Phariſee,</em> rails, when he gives<br />
Thanks. He interprets Propheſies, as <em>Whitting-<br />
ton</em> did the Bells, to ſpeak to him, and governs<br />
himſelf accordingly.<br />

<p>R<sup>2</sup>IDES behind his Wife, and lets her<br />
wear the Spurs and governs the Reins. He<br />
is a Kind of prepoſterous Animal, that being<br />
curbed in goes with his Tail forwards. He is<br />
but ſubordinate and miniſterial to his Wife,<br />
who commands in chief, and he dares do no-<br />
thing without her Order. She takes Place of him,<br />
and he creeps in at the Bed’s Feet, as if he had<br />
married the <em>Grand Seignor</em>’s Daughter, and is<br />
under Correction of her Pantofle. He is his<br />
Wife’s Villain, and has nothing of his own<br />
further than ſhe pleaſes to allow him. When<br />
he was married he promiſed to worſhip his<br />
Wife with his Soul inſtead of his Body, and<br />
endowed her among his worldly Goods with his<br />
Humanity. He changed Sexes with his Wife,<br />
and put off the old Man to put on the new<br />
Woman. She ſits as the Helm, and he does<br />
but tug like a Slave at the Oar. The little<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Wit he has being held <em>in capite</em> has rendered all<br />
the reſt of his Concerments liable to Pupi-<br />
lage and Wardſhip, and his Wife has the<br />
Tuition of his during his or her Life ; and<br />
he has no Power to do any Thing of himſelf,<br />
but by his Guardian. His Wife manages him<br />
and his Eſtate with equal Authority, and he<br />
lives unde rher aribtrary Government and Com-<br />
mand as his ſuperior Office. He is but a kind<br />
of Meſſuage and Tenement in the Occupation<br />
of his Wife. He and ſhe make up a Kind of<br />
Hermaphrodite, a Monſter, or which the one<br />
half is more than the whole ; for he is the<br />
weaker Veſſel, and but his Wife's Helper. His<br />
Wife eſpouſed and took him to Huſband for<br />
better or worſe, and the laſt Word ſtands.<br />
He was meant to be his Wife's Head, but being<br />
ſet on at the wrong End ſhe makes him ſerve<br />
(like the Jeſuits Devil) for her Feet. He is her<br />
Province, an Acquiſition that ſhe took in,<br />
and gives Laws to at Indiſcretion ; for being<br />
overmatched and too feeble for the Encounter,<br />
he was forced to ſubmit and take Quarter.<br />
He has inverted the Curſe, and turned it upon<br />
himſelf ; for his Deſire is towards his Wife,<br />
and ſhe reign over him, and with <em>Eſau</em> has<br />
ſold his Birthright for a Meſs of Matrimony.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>His Wife took his Liberty among his worldly<br />
Goods, to have and to hold till Death them<br />
do part. He is but Groom of his Wife’s<br />
Chamber, and her menial Huſband, that is<br />
always in waiting, and a Slave only in the Right<br />
of his Wife.<br />

<p>I<sup>2</sup>S one, that would fain make himſelf that,<br />
which <em>Nature</em> never meant him ; like a <em>Fa-</em><br />
<em>natic</em>, that inſpires himſelf with his own<br />
Whimſies. He ſets up Haberdaſher of ſmall<br />
Poetry, with a very ſmall Stock, and no Credit.<br />
He believes it is Invention enough to find out<br />
other Men’s Wit ; and whatſoever he lights upon<br />
either in Books, or Company, he makes bold<br />
with as his own. This he puts together ſo un-<br />
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit<br />
has the Rickets, by the ſwelling Diſproportion<br />
of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of<br />
him ; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that<br />
he has catched of others ; and his Flame like<br />
that of Charcoals, that were burnt before :<br />
But as he wants Judgment to underſtand what<br />

moſt agreeable to his own Talent. You may<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>know his Wit not to be natural, ’tis ſo un-<br />
quiet and troubleſome in him : For as thoſe,<br />
that have Money but ſeldom, are always ſhak-<br />
ing their Pockets, when they have it ; ſo does<br />
he, when he thinks he has got ſomething, that<br />
will make him appear. He is a perpetual Tal-<br />
ker ; and you may know by the Freedom of his<br />
Diſcourſe, that he came light by it, as Thieves<br />
ſpend freely what they get. He meaſures other<br />
Men’s Wits by <em>their</em> Modeſty, and his own by<br />
<em>his</em> Confidence. He makes nothing of writing<br />
Plays, becauſe he has not Wit enough to un-<br />
derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-<br />
ture to talk and ſcribble, as Chowſes do to play<br />
with cunning Gameſters, until they are cheated<br />
and laughed at. He is always talking of Wit,<br />
as thoſe, that have bad Voices, are always ſing-<br />
ing out of Tune ; and thoſe, that cannot play,<br />
delight to fumble on Inſtruments. He grows<br />
the unwiſer by other Men’s Harms ; for the<br />
worſe others write, he finds the more Encou-<br />
ragement to do ſo too. His Greedineſs of<br />
Praiſe is ſo eager, that he ſwallows any Thing,<br />
that comes in the Likeneſs of it, how notorious<br />
and palpable ſoever, and is as Shot-free againſt<br />
any Thing, that may leſſen his good Opinion<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>of himſelf---This renders him incurable, like<br />
Diſeaſes, that grow inſenſible.</p>
<p>If you diſlike him it is at your own Peril ;<br />
he is ſure to put in a Caveat beforehand againſt<br />
your Understanding ; and, like a Malefactor<br />
in Wit, is always furniſhed with Exceptions<br />
againſt his Judges. This puts him upon perpe-<br />
tual Apologies, Excuſes, and Defences, but<br />
ſtill by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-<br />
fling Strain, without Regard of any Man,<br />
that ſtands in the Way of his Pageant.<br />
Where he thinks he may do it ſafely, he<br />
will confidently own other Men’s Writings ;<br />
and where he fears the Truth may be diſcovered,<br />
he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inſinua-<br />
tions give Men Occaſion to ſuppoſe ſo.</p>
<p>If he underſtands <em>Latin</em> or <em>Greek</em> he ranks<br />
himſelf among the Learned, deſpiſes the Igno-<br />
rant, talks Criticiſms out of <em>Scaliger</em>, and re-<br />
peats <em>Martial</em>'s baudy Epigrams, and ſets up<br />
his Reſt wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be<br />
not ſo well qualified, he crys down all Learning<br />
as pedantic, diſclaims Study, and profeſſes to<br />
write with as great Facility, as if his Muſe was<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>ſliding down <em>Parnaſſus</em>. Whatſoever he hears<br />
well ſaid<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> he ſeizes upon by poetical Licence ;<br />
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill<br />
repeating of it---This he believes to be no<br />
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others<br />
throw away. By this means his Writings are,<br />
like a Taylor’s Cuſhion, of moſaic Work,<br />
made up of ſeveral Scraps ſewed together.<br />
He calls a ſlovenly naſty Deſcription <em>great Na-</em><br />
<em>ture</em>, and dull Flatneſs <em>strange Eaſineſs</em>. He<br />
writes down all that comes in his Head, and<br />
makes no Choice, becauſe he has nothing to<br />
do it with, that is Judgment. He is always<br />
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like<br />
the <em>long Parliament</em> making <em>Ordinances</em> in their<br />
Stead ; although they are perpetually <em>thrown</em><br />
<em>out</em> of Coffee-Houſes, and come to Nothing.<br />
He is like an <em>Italian</em> Thief, that never robs,<br />
but he murthers, to prevent Diſcovery ; ſo ſure<br />
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-<br />
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may paſs<br />
unſuſpected. He is but a Copier at beſt, and<br />
will never arrive to practice by the Life : For<br />
bar him the Imitation of ſomething he has<br />
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.</p>
<hr />
<p>Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form<br />
of juſt Wit, are above his Philoſophy. He<br />
appears ſo over concerned in all Men’s Wits,<br />
as if they were but Diſparagements of his<br />
own ; and crys down all they do, as if they<br />
were Encroachments upon him. He takes<br />
Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them, as<br />
<em>Justices</em> do falſe Weights, and Pots that want<br />
Meaſure. When he meets with any Thing,<br />
that is very good, he changes it into ſmall<br />
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to<br />
ſerve ſeveral Occaſions. He diſclaims Study,<br />
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to ſhoot<br />
flying, which appears to be very true by his<br />
often miſſing of his Mark. His Wit is much<br />
troubled with Obſtructions ; and he has Fits as<br />
painful as thoſe of the Spleen. He fancies him-<br />
ſelf a dainty ſpruce Shepherd, with a Flock and<br />
a fine ſilken Shepherdeſs, that follows his Pipe,<br />
as Rats did the Conjurers in <em>Germany</em>.</p>
<p>As for <em>Epithets</em>, he always avoids thoſe, that<br />
are near akin to the Senſse. Such matches are<br />
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a <em>Chriſtian</em><br />
Poet ; and therefore all his Care is to chuſe out<br />
[^2]: [<em>footnote cont'd from prev. page</em>] <em>Quem recitas meus eſt, O Fidentine, libellus :</em><br />
<em>Sed male dum recitas, incipit eſſe tuus.    Mart. L. 1. Ep. 39.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>ſuch, as will ſerve, like a wooden Leg, to piece<br />
out a main’d Verſe, that wants a Foot or two ;<br />
and if they will but rhimes now and then into<br />
the Bargain, or run upon a Letter, it is a Work<br />
of Supererrogation.</p>
<p>For <em>Similitudes</em>, he likes the hardeſt and moſt<br />
obſcure beſt : For as Ladies wear black Patches,<br />
to make their Complexions ſeem fairer than<br />
they are ; ſo when an Illuſtration is more ob-<br />
ſcure than the Senſe that went before it, it muſt<br />
of Neceſſity make it appear clearer than it<br />
did : For Contraries are beſt ſet off with Con-<br />
traries.</p>
<p>He has found out a Way to ſave the Expence<br />
of much Wit and Senſe : For he will make<br />
leſs than ſome have prodigally laid out upon<br />
five or ſix Words ſerve forty or fifty Lines.<br />
This is a thrifty Invention, and very eaſy ; and,<br />
if it were commonly known, would much in-<br />
creaſe the Trade of Wit, and maintain a Mul-</p>
<hr />
<p>titude of ſmall Poets in conſtant Employment.<br />
He has found out a new Sort of poetical <em>Geor-</em><br />
<em>gics</em>, a Trick of ſowing Wit like clover-graſs<br />
on barren Subjects, which would yield nothing<br />
before. This is very uſeful for the Times,<br />
wherein, ſome Men ſay, there is no Room left<br />
for new Invention. He will take three Grains<br />
of Wit like the Elixir, and projecting it upon<br />
the <em>Iron-Age</em> turn it immediately into <em>Gold---</em><br />
All the Buſineſs of Mankind has preſently<br />
vaniſhed, the whole World has kept Holiday ;<br />
there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,<br />
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdeſſes ;<br />
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed<br />
Plum-Porrige.</p>
<p>We read that <em>Virgil</em> uſed to make<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> fifty or<br />
ſixty Verſes in a Morning, and afterwards re-<br />
duce them to ten. This was an unthrifty<br />
Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the<br />
Huſbandry of his own Poetry, as <em>Seneca</em> ſays<br />
he was in that of a Farm ;<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> for in plain <em>Engliſh</em></p>
<hr />
<p>it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine-<br />
pence. And as ſuch Courſes brought the<br />
<em>prodigal Son</em> to eat with Hogs : So they did him<br />
to feed with Horſes,<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> which were not much<br />
better Company, and may teach us to avoid<br />
doing the like. For certainly it is more noble<br />
to take four or five Grains of Senſe, and, like<br />
a Gold-Beater, hammer them into ſo many<br />
Leaves as will fill a whole Book ; than to write<br />
nothing but Epitomies, which many wiſe Men<br />
believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.</p>
<p>When he writes, he commonly ſteers the<br />
Senſe of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the<br />
End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the<br />
Tail. For when he has made one Line, which<br />
is eaſy enough ; and has found out ſome ſturdy<br />
hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham-<br />
mer the Senſe upon it, like a Piece of hot Iron<br />
upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleaſes.</p>
<p>There is no Art in the World ſo rich in<br />
Terms as Poetry ; a whole Dictionary is ſcarce</p>
<hr />
<p>able to contain them : For there is hardly a<br />
Pond, a Sheep-walk, or a Gravel-pit in all<br />
<em>Greece</em>, but the antient Name of it is become<br />
a Term of Art in Poetry. By this means ſmall<br />
Poets have ſuch a Stock of able hard Words lying<br />
by them, as <em>Dryades</em>, <em>Hamadryades</em>, <em>Aonides</em>, <em>Fauni</em>,<br />
<em>Nymphae</em>, <em>Sylvani</em>, <em>&amp;c</em>. that ſignify nothing at all ;<br />
and ſuch a World of pedantic Terms of the<br />
ſame Kind, as may ſerve to furniſh all the new<br />
Inventions and <em>thorough-Reformations</em>, that can<br />
happen between this and <em>Plato</em>’s great Year.</p>
<p>When he writes he never propoſes any Scope<br />
or Purpoſe to himſelf, but gives his Genius all<br />
Freedom : For as he, that rides abroad for his<br />
Pleaſure, can hardly be out of his Way ; ſo he<br />
that writes for his Pleaſure, can ſeldom be be-<br />
ſide his Subject. It is an ungrateful Thing to<br />
a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing---<br />
To what Purpoſe did the Antients feign <em>Pegaſus</em><br />
to have Wings, if he muſt be confined to the<br />
Road and Stages like a Pack-Horſe, or be forced<br />
to be obedient to Hedges and Ditches? There-</p>
<hr />
<p>fore he has no Reſpect to Decorum and Pro-<br />
priety of Circumſtance ; for the Regard of<br />
Perſons, Times, and Places is a Reſtraint too<br />
ſervile to be impoſed upon poetical Licence ;<br />
like him that made <em>Plato</em><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> confeſs <em>Juvenal</em> to be<br />
a Philoſopher, or <em>Perſius</em>, that calls the <em>Athe</em>-<br />
<em>nians Quirites</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>Metaphors</em>, he uſes to chuſe the hardeſt,<br />
and moſt far-fet that he can light upon---Theſe<br />
are the Jewels of Eloquence, and therefore the<br />
harder they are, the more precious they muſt<br />
be.</p>
<p>He’ll take ſcant Piece of coarſe Senſe, and<br />
ſtretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a ſcore<br />
Rhimes, until it crack that you may ſee through<br />
it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head. When<br />
you ſee his Verſes hanged up in Tobacco-Shops,<br />
you may ſay, in defiance of the Proverb, <em>that</em><br />
<em>the weakeſt does not always go to the Wall</em> ; for ’tis</p>
<hr />
<p>well known the Lines are ſtrong enough, and<br />
in that Senſe may juſtly take the Wall of any,<br />
that have been written in our Language. He<br />
ſeldom makes a Conſcience of his Rhimes ; but<br />
will often take the Liberty to make <em>preach</em><br />
rhime with <em>Cheat</em>, <em>Vote</em> with <em>Rogue</em>, and <em>Com</em>-<br />
<em>mittee-Man</em> with <em>Hang</em>.</p>
<p>He’ll make one Word of as many Joints, as<br />
the Tin-Pudding, that a Jugler pulls out of<br />
his Throat, and chops in again---What think<br />
you of <em>glud-fum-flam-hasta-minantes ?</em> Some of<br />
the old <em>Latin</em> Poets<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> bragged, that their Verſes<br />
were tougher than Braſs, and harder than<br />
Marble ; what would they have done, if they<br />
had ſeen theſe ? Verily they would have had<br />
more reaſon to wiſh themſelves an hundred<br />
Throats, than they then had, to pronounce them.</p>
<p>There are ſome, that drive a Trade in writ-<br />
ing in praiſe of other Writers, (like Rooks,</p>

apt to receive any Impres<em>s</em>ion, but retain none.<br />
His Mind is made of changeable Stuff, that<br />
alters Colour with every Motion towards the<br />
Light. He is a Cormorant, that has but one<br />
Gut, devours every Thing greedily, but it runs<br />
through him immediately. He does not know<br />
s<em>o much as what he would be, and yet would<br />
be every Thing he knows. He is like a Paper-<br />
Lanthorn, that turns with the Smoak of a<br />

Laws of the Land have provided, according<br />
to his Quality, that he may be known what<br />
he is by them; and it is as eas</em>y to decipher<br />
him by his Habit as a [i] Pudding. He is rigg'd<br />

tell, at the firs</em>t View, whether they have the<br />

He puts off the <em>old Man</em>, but puts it on again upon the <em>new one,</em> and makes his <em>Pagan</em> Vices ſerve to preſerve his <em>Chriſtian</em> Virtues from wearing out ; for if he ſhould uſe his Piety and Devotion al- ways it would hold out but a little while. He is loth that Iniquity and Vice ſhould be thrown away, as long as there may be good Uſe of it ; for if that, which is wickedly gotten, may be diſposed to pious Uſes, why ſhould not Wickedneſs itſelf as well? He believes himſelf Shot-free againſt all the Attempts of the <em>Devil,</em> the <em>World,</em> and the <em>Flesh,</em> and therefore is not afraid to attack them in their own Quarters, and encounter them at their own Weapons.</p>

the King and his Subjects. He calls himſelf<br />

unſufferable Tyranny over Words ; for when<br />
he has enſlaved and debaſed them from their<br />
original Senſe, he makes them ſerves againſt<br />
themselves to ſupport him, and their own<br />
Abuſe. He is as ſtiff to Delinquents, and<br />
makes as harſh a Noiſe as a new Cart-wheel,<br />

Formality of Law, arbitrary and illegal, but<br />
never conſiders, that his own Interpretation<br />

pleaſes, illegal. He cannot be denied to be a<br />
very impartial Judge ; for right or wrong<br />

they never make a dry Reckoning. When he<br />
comes to be Lord-Mayor he does not keep a<br />
great Houſe, but a very great Houſe-warming<br />
for a whole Year ; for though he invites all the<br />
<em>Companies</em> in the City he does not treat them,<br />
but they club to entertain him, and pay the<br />
Reckoning beforehand. His Fur-gown makes<br />
him look a great deal bigger than he is, like<br />
the Feathers of an Owl, and when he pulls<br />
it off, he looks as if he were fallen away, or<br />
like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.<br />

<p>I<sup>2</sup>S a Scoundrel Saint, of an Order without<br />
Founder, Vow, or Rule ; for he will not<br />
ſwear, nor be tyed to any Thing, but his own<br />
Humour. He is the Link-Boy of the Sectaries,<br />
and talks much of his Light, but puts it under<br />
a Buſhel, for nobody can ſee it but himſelf. His<br />
Religion is but the cold Fit of an Ague, and his<br />
Zeal of a contrary Temper to that of all others,<br />
yet produces the ſame Effects ; as cold Iron in<br />
<em>Greenland</em>, they ſay, burns as well as hot ;<br />
which makes him delight, like a Salamander,<br />
to live in the Fire of Perſecution. He works<br />
out his Salvation, not with <em>Fear</em>, but <em>Confidence</em><br />
<em>and Trembling</em>. His Profeſſion is but a Kind<br />
of Winter-Religion ; and the Original of it as<br />
uncertain as the hatching of Woodcocks, for<br />
no Man can tell from whence it came. He<br />
Vapours much of the Light within him, but<br />
no ſuch Thing appears, unleſs he means as he<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>is light-headed. He believes he takes up the<br />
Croſs in being croſs to all Mankind. He de_<br />
lights in Perſecution, as ſome old extravagant<br />
Fornicators find a Lechery in being whipt ;<br />
and has no Ambition but to go to Heaven in<br />
what he calls a fiery Chariot, that is, a Wood-<br />
monger’s Faggot Cart. You may perceive he<br />
has a Crack in his Skill by the flat Twang of<br />
his Noſe, and the great Care he takes to keep<br />
his Hat on, leſt his ſickly Brains, if he have<br />
any, ſhould take Cold at it. He believes his<br />
Doctrine to be heavenly, becauſe it agrees per-<br />
fectly with the <em>Motus Trepidationis</em>. All his<br />
Hopes are in the <em>Turks</em> overrunning of Chriſ-<br />
tendom, becauſe he has heard they count Fools<br />
and Madmen Saints, and doubts not to paſs<br />
muſter with them for great Abilities that Way.<br />
This makes him believe he can convert the <em>Turk</em>,<br />
tho’ he could do no good on the <em>Pope</em>, or the<br />
<em>Preſbyterian</em>. Nothing comes ſo near his quak-<br />
ing Liturgy, as the Papiſtical Poſſeſſions of the<br />
<em>Devil</em>, with which it conforms in Diſcipline<br />
exact. His Church, or rather Chapel, is built<br />
upon a flat Sand, without ſuperior or inferior<br />
in it, and not upon a Rock, which is never<br />
found without great Inequalities. Next De_<br />
moniacs he moſt reſembles the Reprobate, who<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>are ſaid to be condemned to Weeping and<br />
Gnaſhing of Teeth. There was a Botcher of<br />
their Church, that renounced his Trade and<br />
turned Preacher, becauſe he held it ſuperſtiti-<br />
ous to ſit <em>croſs-legged</em>. His Devotion is but a<br />
Kind of ſpiritual Palſy, that proceeds from a<br />
Diſtemper in the Brain, where the Nerves are<br />
rooted. They abhor the Church of <em>England</em>,<br />
but conform exactly with thoſe primitive Fa-<br />
theres of their Church, that heretofore gave An-<br />
ſwers at the <em>Devil</em>’s Oracles, in which they ob-<br />
ſerved the very ſame Ceremony of quaking and<br />
and gaping now practiſed by our modern En_<br />
thuſiaſts at their Exorciſms, rather than Ex-<br />
erciſes of Devotion. He ſucks in the Air like<br />
a Pair of Bellows, and blows his inward Light<br />
with it, till he dung Fire, as Cattle do in <em>Lin</em>-<br />
<em>colnſhire</em>. The general Ignorance of their<br />
whole Party make it appear, that whatſoever<br />
their Zeal may be, it is not <em>according to Know</em>-<br />

guilty of half the Injuries he does them, and<br />
he believes the reſt to be none at all, becauſe<br />
no Injury can be done to him, that is willing<br />
to take it. He had rather ſell bad Wine, than<br />
good that ſtands him in no more, for it makes<br />
Men ſooner drunk, and then they are the eaſier<br />
over-reckoned. By the Knaveries he acts<br />

Wines he raiſes his Price, and to make amends<br />
for that abates his Meaſure, for he thinks it<br />
a greater Sin to commit Murder for ſmall<br />
Gains, than a valuable Conſideration. He<br />
does not only ſpoil and deſtroy his Wines, but<br />
an ancient reverend Proverb, with brewing and<br />
racking, that ſays, <em>In vino veritas</em>, for there<br />
is no Truth in his, but all falſe and ſophiſtica-<br />
ted ; for he can counterfeit Wine as cunningly<br />
as <em>Apelles</em> did Grapes, and cheat Men with it,<br />
as <em>he</em> did Birds. He brings every Bottle of<br />
Wine he draws to the <em>Bar</em>, to confeſs it to be<br />
a Cheat, and afterwards puts himſelf upon<br />
the Mercy of the Company. He is an <em>Anti-</em><br />
<em>chriſtian</em> Cheat ; for Chriſt turned Water into<br />
Wine, and he turns Wine into Water. He<br />
ſcores all his Reckonings upon two Tables<br />
made like thoſe of the ten Commandments, that<br />
he may be put in Mind to break them as oft as<br />
poſſibly he can ; eſpecially that of ſtealing and<br />
bearing falſe Witneſs againſt his Neighbour,<br />
when he draws him bad Wine and ſwears it is<br />
good, and that he can take more for the Pipe<br />
than the Wine will yield him by the Bottle,<br />
a Trick that a <em>Jesuit</em> taught him to cheat his<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>own Conſcience with. When he is found to<br />
over-reckon notoriouſly, he has one common<br />
Evaſion for all, and that is to ſay it was a<br />

He is very tender and careful in preſerving<br />
