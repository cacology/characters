HUFFING COURTIER</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S a Cypher, that has no Value himſelf, but<br />
from the Place he ſtands in. All his Hap-<br />
pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others<br />
have of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-<br />
retical and erroneous, though he ſuffer much<br />
Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate, and<br />
not to be convinced. He flutters up and down<br />
like a Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is<br />
pruning of his Peruque takes Occaſion to con-<br />
template his Legs, and the Symmetry of his<br />
Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the<br />
Rooms, and ſerves for a walking Picture, a<br />
moving Piece of Arras. His Buſineſs is only<br />
to be ſeen, and he performs it with admirable<br />
Industry, placing himself always in the beſt<br />
Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-<br />
tious whom he mixes withal. His Occupation<br />
is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if they could but<br />
walk themselves, they would ſave him the </p>
<hr />
<p>Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.<br />
His Immunity from Varlets is his Freehold,<br />
and he were a loſt Man without it. His<br />
Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he<br />
gives him, for ’tis ten to one he never pays for<br />
them. He is very careful to diſcover the Lining<br />
of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect any<br />
Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the<br />
Skin outwards. His Taylor is his Creator,<br />
and makes him of nothing ; and though he<br />
lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_<br />
mitting Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells<br />
in the Outſide of him, like that of a hollow<br />
Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off him<br />
he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of<br />
himſelf is the wearing of his Cloaths, and,<br />
like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is better than<br />
his Body. His looking big is rather a Tumor,<br />
than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt<br />
ſo much Value, as other Men give him that<br />
believe in him, but none of his own. He<br />
makes his Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like<br />
a Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get<br />
through. He has juſt ſo much of Politics, as<br />
Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have <em>Latin</em>. He is<br />
as humble as a Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that<br />
are below him ; and with a generous Scorn<br />
deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither do him good,<br />
nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do him<br />
good, though he knows they never will ; and<br />
deſpiſes thoſe, that would not hurt him, if<br />
they could. The Court is his Church, and he<br />
believes as that believes, and cries up and down<br />
every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a<br />
great Comfort to him to think, that ſome who<br />
do not know him may perhaps take him for a<br />
Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he looks<br />
bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-<br />
tance ; and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-<br />
times know you, and ſometimes not. Nothing<br />
but want of Money or Credit puts him in<br />
mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts<br />
Providence that ſomebody will truſt him ; and<br />
in Expectation of that hopes for a better Life,<br />
and that his Debts will never riſe up in Judg-<br />
ment against him. To get in debt is to labour<br />
in his Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his<br />
Protection ; for what’s that worth to one that<br />
owes Nothing ? His Employment being only to<br />
wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his<br />
Life and Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers<br />
Books, that are his faithful Hiſtoriographers to<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes<br />
ſo much Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;<br />
and that no Man wears his Cloaths in Faſhion,<br />
that pays for them, for noting is further from<br />
the Mode. He believes that he that runs in<br />
Debt is beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,<br />
and only thoſe, that pay, are behind. His<br />
Brains are turned giddy, like one that walks<br />
on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon<br />
it is ſo troubleſome to him to look downwards.<br />
He is a Kind of Spectrum, and his Cloaths are<br />
the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ; and<br />
when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs<br />
as buſily out of one Room into another, as a<br />
great Practiſer does in <em>Weſtminſter</em>-Hall from<br />
one Court to another. When he accoſts a<br />
Lady he puts both Ends of his Microcoſm in<br />
Motion, by making Legs at one End, and<br />
combing his Peruque at the other. His Gar-<br />
niture is the Sauce to his Cloaths, and he walks<br />
in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in long<br />
Graſs. Every Motion of him crys <em>Vanity of</em><br />
<em>Vanities, all is Vanity,</em> quoth the Preacher. He<br />
rides himself like a well-managed Horſe, reins<br />
in his Neck, and walks <em>Terra Terra</em>. He<br />
carries his elbows backward, as if he were<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as<br />
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit. His Legs are<br />
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like<br />
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant<br />
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not<br />
cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long<br />
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now<br />
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover<br />
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of<br />
Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of<br />
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,<br />
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being<br />
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When he<br />
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-<br />
men do their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons<br />
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a<br />
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,<br />
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-<br />
rows from Reflection. He is as tender of his<br />
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as<br />
loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery<br />
is all his Happineſs ; and like <em>Atlas</em> he carries<br />
his Heaven on his Back. He is like the golden<br />
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He<br />
is a Monſter or an <em>Indian</em> Creature, that is<br />
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.<br />
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-<br />
dies to play upon, who when they have done<br />
with him, let down his treble-String, till they<br />
are in the Humour again. His Cook and Va-<br />
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and<br />
him ſo punctually together, that the one may<br />
not be ready before the other. As Peacocks and<br />
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,<br />
yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to flutter<br />
only. The Beggars call him <em>my Lord,</em> and he<br />
takes them at their Words, and pays them for<br />
it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-<br />
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make<br />
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-<br />
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him<br />
when you have him.<br />

ANTIQUARY</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S one that has his Being in this Age, but<br />
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of<br />
old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-<br />
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great<br />
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like<br />
the Madman, that fell in Love with <em>Cleopatra</em>.<br />
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has<br />
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten<br />
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm<br />
in his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and<br />
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as<br />
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts. He<br />
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his<br />
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which<br />
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a<br />
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into<br />
the World. He ſpends the one half of his<br />
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes<br />
ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does<br />
it, the further they are from being new to him.<br />
All his Curiouſities take place of one another<br />
according to their Seniority, and he values<br />
them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.<br />
He has a great Veneration for Words that are<br />
ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that<br />
they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe<br />
he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-<br />
tiquity, and the good Services they have done.<br />
He throws away his Time in enquiring after<br />
that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,<br />
like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find<br />
out another that was loſt before. He fetches<br />
things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable<br />
of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own<br />
Aſhes. He values one old Invention, that is<br />
loſt and never to be recovered, before all the<br />
new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.<br />
The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with<br />
his, that ſhows the Tombs at <em>Westminster</em>, only<br />
the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other<br />
for Money. As every Man has but one Fa-<br />
ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World<br />
of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>for Things that are antient, and the further off<br />
the greater.</p>
<p>He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time<br />
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,<br />
but is wholly retied from the preſent. His<br />
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came<br />
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is<br />
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of<br />
them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to<br />
any Thing that is old, that he may truly <em>ſay to</em><br />
<em>Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-</em><br />
<em>tenneſs thou are my Mother</em>. He has no Provi-<br />
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-<br />
tions look backward upon the Days of old,<br />
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he<br />
walked backwards. He had rather interpret<br />
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-<br />
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious<br />
new one ; and with <em>Scaliger</em> would ſell the<br />
Empire of <em>Germany</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (if it were in his Power)<br />
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-<br />
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths<br />
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>it above any Thing printed, which he accounts<br />
but a Novelty. When he happens to cure a<br />
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud<br />
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,<br />
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.<br />
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-<br />
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are<br />
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the<br />
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds<br />
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they<br />
are made up. He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch<br />
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince<br />
out of Uſe ; as the <em>Catholics</em> allow of no Saints,<br />
but ſuch as are dead, and the <em>Fanatics</em>, Op-<br />
poſition, of none but the Living.<br />

boils over like a Porridge-Pot. He ſets out<br />
his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem<br />
bigger than he is. He is troubled with a Tu-<br />
mour and Inflammation of Self-Conceit, that<br />
renders every Part of him ſtiff and uneaſy.<br />
He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-<br />
der, that works upon him to Dotage, and has<br />
transformed him into his own Miſtreſs. He<br />
is his own Gallant, and makes moſt paſſionate<br />
Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections. He<br />
commits Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips<br />
his own Image ; though there is no Soul living<br />
of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes as<br />
the Church believes, and maintains his Faith<br />
with the Obſtinacy of a <em>Fanatic.</em> He is his own<br />
Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above<br />
his Merit, but all Mankind ; is both <em>Damon</em><br />
and <em>Pythias</em> to his own dear ſelf, and values his<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Crony above his Soul. He gives Place to no<br />
Man but himſelf, and that with very great<br />
Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems not<br />
worthy to approach him. He believes what-<br />
ſoever he has receives a Value in being his ;<br />
as a Horſe in a Nobleman’s Stable will bear a<br />
greater Price than in a common Market. He<br />
is ſo proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted<br />
with himſelf as with others ; for he is very<br />
apt to forget who he is, and knows himſelf<br />
only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats himſelf<br />
civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and Com-<br />
pliment, but admits of no Privacy. He ſtrives<br />
to look bigger than himſelf, as well as others,<br />
and is no better than his own Paraſite and<br />
Flatterer. A little Flood will make a ſhallow<br />
Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and<br />
foam, and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep<br />
ſilent Stream glides quietly on. So a vain-<br />
glorious inſolent proud Man ſwells with a little<br />
frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-<br />
flows his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves<br />
Mud and Dirt behind him. His Carriage is<br />
as glorious and haughty, as if he were advan-<br />
ced upon Men’s Shoulders, or tumbled over<br />
their Heads like Knipperdolling. He fancies </p>
<hr />
<p>himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head<br />
holds no Proportion to his Body, and his foun-<br />
dation is leſſer than his upper Stories. We<br />
can naturally take no view of our ſelves, un-<br />
leſs we look downwards, to teach us how<br />
humble Admirers we ought to be of our own<br />
Values. The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his Mate-<br />
rials are, the more Room they take up, and<br />
make him ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and<br />
Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions better than Things<br />
of more cloſe and ſolid Parts.<br />

<em>Oberon,</em> to erect their Monarchy in <em>Fairy-Land,</em><br />

His Mind is made of changeable Stuff, that<br />
alters Colour with every Motion towards the<br />

Gut, devours every Thing greedily, but it runs<br />
through him immediately. He does not know<br />

<p>I<sup>2</sup>s one, that keeps the worſt Company in the<br />
World, that is, his own; and tho' he be al-<br />
ways falling out and quarrelling with himſelf,<br />
yet he has not power to endure any other Con-<br />
verſation. His Head is haunted, like a Houſe,<br />
with evil Spirits and Apparitions, that terrify<br />
and fright him out of himſelf, till he ſtands<br />
empty and forſaken. His Sleeps and his Wa-<br />
kings are ſo much the ſame, that he knows not<br />
how to diſtinguiſh them, and many times<br />
when he dreams, he believes he is broad awake<br />
and ſees Viſions. The Fumes and Vapours<br />
that riſe from his Spleen and Hypocondries<br />
have ſo ſmutched and ſullied his Brain (like a<br />
Room that ſmoaks) that his Underſtanding is<br />
blear-ey'd, and has no right Perception of any<br />
Thing. His Soul lives in his Body, like a<br />
Mole in the Earth, that labours in the Dark,<br />
and caſts up Doubts and Scruples of his own</p>
<hr />
<p>Imagination, to make that rugged and uneaſy,<br />
that was plain and open before. His Brain is<br />
ſo cracked, that he fancies himſelf to be Glaſs,<br />
and is afraid that every Thing he comes near<br />
ſhould break him in Pieces. Whatſoever makes<br />
an Impreſſion in his Imagination works it ſelf<br />
in like a Screw, and the more he turns and<br />
winds it, the deeper it ſticks, till it is never to<br />
be got out again. The Temper of his Brain<br />
being earthy, cold, and dry, is apt to breed<br />
Worms, that ſink ſo deep into it, no Medicine<br />
in Art or Nature is able to reach them. He<br />
leads his Life, as one leads a Dog in a Slip<br />
that will not follow, but is dragged along until<br />
he is almoſt hanged, as he has it often under<br />
Conſideration to treat himſelf in convenient<br />
Time and Place, if he can but catch himſelf<br />
alone. After a long and mortal Feud between<br />
his inward and his outward Man, they at<br />
length agree to meet without Seconds, and decide the<br />
Quarrel, in which the one drops, and the<br />
other ſinks out fo the Way, and makes his<br />
Eſcape into ſome foreign World, from whence<br />
is it never after heard of. He converſes with<br />
nothing ſo much as his own Imagination,<br />
which being apt to miſrepreſent Things to him,</p>
<hr />
<p>makes him believe, that it is ſomething elſe<br />
than it is, and that he holds Intelligence with<br />
Spirits, that reveal whatſoever he fancies to<br />
him, as the antient rude People, that firſt heard<br />
their own Voices repeated by Echoes in the<br />
Woods, concluded it muſt proceed from ſome<br />
invisible Inhabitants of thoſe ſolitary Places,<br />
which they after believed to be Gods, and<br />
called them <em>Sylvans, Fauns,</em> and <em>Dryads.</em> He<br />
makes the Infirmity of his Temper paſs for<br />
Revelations, as <em>Mahomet</em> did by his falling<br />
Sickneſs, and inſpires himſelf with the Wind<br />
of his own Hypocondries. He laments, like<br />
<em>Heraclitus</em> the Maudlin Philoſopher, at other<br />
Men's Mirth, and take Pleaſures in nothing<br />
but his own un-ſober Sadneſs. His Mind is<br />
full of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like<br />
a Neſt of Boxes. He ſleeps little, but dreams<br />
much, and ſoundeſt when he is waking. He<br />
ſees Viſions further off than a ſecond-ſighted<br />
Man in <em>Scotland,</em> and dreams upon a hard<br />
Point with admirable Judgement. He is juſt<br />
ſo much worſe than a Madman, as he is below<br />
him in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen<br />
the moſt mad govern all the reſt, and receive<br />
a natural Obedience from their Inferiors.</p>

<p>I<sup>2</sup>s a <em>Fanatic</em> Hector, that has found out by a very ſtrange Way of new Light, how to transform all the <em>Devils</em> into <em>Angels of Light</em> ; for he believes all Religion conſiſts in Looſeneſs, and that Sin and Vice is <em>the whole Duty of Man</em>. He puts off the <em>old Man</em>, but puts it on again upon the <em>new one,</em> and makes his <em>Pagan</em> Vices ſerve to preſerve his <em>Chriſtian</em> Virtues from wearing out ; for if he ſhould uſe his Piety and Devotion al- ways it would hold out but a little while. He is loth that Iniquity and Vice ſhould be thrown away, as long as there may be good Uſe of it ; for if that, which is wickedly gotten, may be diſposed to pious Uſes, why ſhould not Wickedneſs itſelf as well? He believes himſelf Shot-free againſt all the Attempts of the <em>Devil,</em> the <em>World,</em> and the <em>Flesh,</em> and therefore is not afraid to attack them in their own Quarters, and encounter them at their own Weapons.</p>
<hr />
<p>For as ſtrong Bodies may freely venture to do,<br />
and ſuffer that, without any Hurt to them-<br />
ſelves, which would deſtroy thoſe that are<br />
feeble: So a Saint, that is ſtrong in Grace,<br />
may boldly engage himſelf in thoſe great Sins<br />
and Iniquities, that would eaſily damn a weak<br />
Brother, and yet come off never the worſe.<br />
He believes Deeds of Darkneſs to be only thoſe<br />
Sins that are committed in private, not thoſe<br />
that are acted openly and owned. He is but<br />
an <em>Hypocrite</em> turned the wrong Side outward ;<br />
for, as the one wears his Vices within, and<br />
the other without, ſo when they are counter-<br />
changed the <em>Ranter</em> becomes an <em>Hypocrite,</em> and<br />
the <em>Hypocrite</em> an able <em>Ranter.</em> His Church is<br />
the <em>Devil's</em> Chappel ; for it agrees exactly both<br />
in Doctorine and Diſicipline with the beſt reform-<br />
ed Baudy-Houſes. He is a Monſter produced<br />
by the Madneſs of this latter Age ; but if it<br />
had been his Fate to have been whelped in old<br />
<em>Rome</em> he had paſt for a Prodigy, and been re-<br />
ceived among raining of Stones and the ſpeak-<br />
ing of Bulls, and would have put a ſtop to all<br />

Advice, when they are paid for it. He wraps<br />
himſelf warm in Furs, that the cold Air may<br />
not ſtrike his Conſcience inward. He is never<br />
an upright Judge, but when he is weary of<br />
ſitting, and ſtands for his Eaſe. All the Uſe<br />
he make of his Oath is to oppoſe it againſt<br />
his Prince, for whoſe Service he firſt took it,<br />
and to bind him with that, which he firſt pre-<br />
tended to bind himſelf with; as if the King by<br />
imparting a little of his Power to him gave<br />
hi to Title to all the reſt, like thoſe who hold-<br />

pleaſes ; yet is a great Enemy to arbitrary<br />
Power, becauſe he would have no Body uſe it<br />

he makes all the Law run on the King's Side ;<br />
if not, it always takes part againſt him ; for as<br />
he was bred to make any Thing right or wrong<br />
between Man and Man, ſo he can do between<br />
the King and his Subjects. He calls himſelf<br />
<em>Capitalis, &amp;c.</em> which Word he never uſes but<br />
to Crimes of the higeſt Nature. He uſurps<br />
unſufferable Tyranny over Words ; for when<br />
he has enſlaved and debaſed them from their<br />
original Senſe, he makes them ſerves againſt<br />
themselves to ſupport him, and their own<br />
Abuſe. He is as ſtiff to Delinquents, and<br />
makes as harſh a Noiſe as a new Cart-wheel,<br />
until he is greaſed, and then he turns about as<br />
eaſily. He called all necceſſary and unavoidable<br />
Proceedings of State, without the punctual<br />
Formality of Law, arbitrary and illegal, but<br />
never conſiders, that his own Interpretation<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>of Law are more arbitrary, and, when he<br />
pleaſes, illegal. He cannot be denied to be a<br />
very impartial Judge ; for right or wrong<br />
are all one to him. He takes Bribes, as pious<br />
Men give Alms, with ſo much Caution, that<br />
his right Hand never knows what his left re-<br />

He is ſo well verſed in all Cafes of Quibble,<br />

a Word, as ſoon as it is out. He packs his<br />
Quibbles like a Stock of Cards, let him but<br />

makes them juſtly eſteemed but Maggots. He<br />
rings the Changes upon Words, and is ſo ex-<br />

many Variations any Number of Words will<br />

Words a double Reliſh. He had rather have<br />
them bear two Senſes in vain and impertinent-<br />

Equivocation and mental Reſervation, and<br />
mightily affects to give a Word a double Stroke,<br />
like a Tennis-Ball againſt two Walls at one<br />
Blow, to defeat the Expectation of his An-<br />
tagonift. He commonly ſlurs every fourth or<br />
fifth Word, and ſeldom fails to throw Dou-<br />
blets. There are two Sorts of Quibbling, the<br />
one with Words, and the other with Senſe,<br />

of conſiderable Advantage to him; and there-<br />
fore has Paſſions lying by him of all Sizes pro-<br />
portionable to all Women’s Fortunes, and can<br />
be indifferent, melancholy, or ſtark-mad, ac-<br />
cording as their Eſtates give him Occaſion; and<br />
when he finds it is to no Purpoſe, can preſently<br />
come to himſelf again, and try another. He  proſecutes his Suit againſt his Miſtreſs as Clients<br />
do a Suit in Law, and does nothing without<br />
the Advice of his learned Council, omits no<br />
Advantage for want of ſoliciting, and, when<br />
He gets her Conſent, overthrows her. He en-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>deavors to match his Eſtate, rather than him-<br />

treſs’s Fortune and his do but come to an<br />
Agreement, their Perſons are eaſily ſatisſied, the<br />
Match is ſoon made up, and a Croſs Marriage<br />
between all four is prefeſtly concluded. He is<br />
not much concerned in his Lady’s Virtues, for if<br />
the Opinion of the <em>Stoics</em> be true, <em>that the vir-</em><br />
<em>tuous are always rich</em>, there is no doubt, but ſhe<br />
that is rich muſt be virtuous. He never goes<br />
without a Liſt in his Pocket of all the Widows<br />
and Virgins about the Town, with Particulars<br />
of their Jointures, Portions, and Inheritances,<br />
that if one miſs he may not be without a Re-<br />
ſerve; for he eſteems <em>Cupid</em> very improvident,<br />
if he has not more than two Strings to his<br />
Bow. When he wants a better Introduction,<br />
he begins his Addreſſes to the Chamber-maid,<br />
like one that ſues the Tenant to eject the Land-<br />
lord, and according as he thrives there makes<br />
his Approaches to the Miſtreſs. He can tell<br />
readily what the Difference is between Join-<br />
Ture with Tution of Infant, Land and<br />
Money of any Value, and what the Odds is<br />
to a Penny between them all, either to take or<br />
leave. He does not ſo much go a wooing as<br />
put in his Claim, as if all Men of Fortune<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>had a fair Title to all Women of the ſame<br />
Quality, and therefore are ſaid to demand them<br />
in Marriage. But if he be a Wooer of For-<br />
tune, that deſigns to raiſe himſelſ by it, he<br />
makes wooing his Vocation, deals with all<br />
Matchmakers, that are his Setters, is very<br />
painful in his Calling, and, if he Buſineſs ſucceed,<br />
ſteals her away and commits Matri-<br />
mony with a ſelonious Intent. He has a great<br />
deſire to beget Money on the Body of a Wo-<br />
man, and as for other Iſſue is very indifferent,<br />
and cares not how old ſhe be, ſo ſhe be not paſt<br />
Money-bearing.<br />

<p><sup>I</sup>s one, whoſe want of Money and want of<br />
Wit have engaged him beyond his Abilities.<br />
The little Knowledge he has of himſelf being<br />
ſuitable to the little he has in his Profeſſion has<br />
Made him believe himſelf fit for it. This double<br />
Ignorance has made him ſet a Value upon him-<br />
ſelf, as he that wants a great deal appears in a<br />
better Condition, than he that wants a little.<br />
This renders him confident, and fit for any<br />
Undertaking, and ſometimes (ſuch is the con-<br />
current Ignorance of the World) he proſpers<br />
In it, but oftner miſcarries, and becomes ri-<br />
diculous; yet this Advantage he has, that as<br />
nothing can make him ſee his Error, ſo he is<br />
fortified with his Ignorance, as barren and<br />
rocky Places are by their Situation, and he will<br />
rather believe that all Men want Judgment,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>than himſelf. For as no Man is pleaſed, that<br />
has an ill Opinion of himſelſ, Nature, that<br />
finds out Remedies herſelf, and his own Eaſe<br />
render him indefenſible of his Defects¬—From<br />
hence he grows impudent; for as Men judge<br />
by Compariſon, he knows as little what it is<br />
To be defective, as what it is to be excellent.<br />
Nothing renders Men modeſt, but a juſt Know-<br />
ledge how to compare themſelves with others;<br />
and where that is wanting, Impudence supplies<br />
the Place of it: for there is no Vacuum in the<br />
Minds of Men, and commonly, like other<br />
Things in Nature, they ſwell more with Rare-<br />
faction than Condenſation. The more Men<br />
know of the World, the worſe Opinion they<br />
have of it; and the more they underſtand of<br />
Truth, they are better acquainted with the<br />
Difficulties of it, and conſsequently are the leſs<br />
confident in their Aſſertions, eſpecially in mat-<br />
ters of Probability, which commonly is ſquint-<br />
ey’d, and looks nine Ways at once. It is the<br />
Office of a juſt Judge to hear both Parties, and<br />
he that conſiders but the one Side of Things<br />
can never make a juſt Judgment, though he<br />
may by Chance a true one. Impudence is the<br />
Baſtard of Ignorance, not only unlawfully,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>but inceſtouſsly begotten by a Man upon his<br />
own Underſtanding, and laid by himſelſ at<br />
his own Door, a Monſter of unnatural Pro-<br />
duction; for Shame is as much the Propriety<br />
of human Nature (though overſeen by the<br />
Philoſsophers) and perhaps more than Reaſon,<br />
Laughing, or looking aſquint, by which they<br />
diſtinguish Man from Beaſts; and the leſs<br />
Men have of it, the nearer they approach to<br />
the Nature of Brutes. Modeſty is but a noble<br />
Jealouſy of Honour, and Impudence the Proſ-<br />
titution of it; for he, whoſe Face is proof<br />
againſt Infamy, muſt be as little ſenſible of<br />
Glory. His Forehead, like a voluntary Cuck-<br />
old’s is by his Horns made Proof againſt a<br />
Bluſh. Nature made Man barefaced, and civil<br />
Cuſtom has preſerved him ſo; but he that’s im-<br />
pudent does wear a Vizard more ugly and de-<br />
formed than Highway Thieves diſguiſe them-<br />
ſelves with. Shame is the tender moral Con-<br />
ſcience of good Men. When there is a Crack<br />
In the Skull, Nature herſelf with a tough horny<br />
Callus repairs the Breach; ſo a flaw’d Intellect is with a brawny Callus Face ſupplied. The<br />
Face is the Dial of the Mind; and where they<br />
Do not go together, ‘tis a Sign, that one or<br />
Both are out of Order. He that is impudent<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>is like a Merchant, that trades upon his Cre-<br />
dit without a Stock, and if his Debts were<br />
known, would break immediately. The Inſide<br />
of his Head is like the Outſide; and his Peruke<br />
as naturally of his own Growth, as his Wit.<br />
He paſſes in the World like a Piece of Counter-<br />
feit Coin, looks well enough until he is rubbed<br />

Him, but by Owl-light.</p>

he catches his Wit, like the Itch, of ſomebody<br />
elſe that had it before, and when he writes he<br />
does but ſcratch himſelf. His Head is, like<br />
his Hat, faſhioned upon a Block, and wrought<br />

melts down his Wit, and caſts it in a Mold:<br />
and as metals melted and caſt are not ſo firm<br />
and ſolid, as thoſe that are wrought with the<br />
Hammer; ſo thoſe Compoſitions, that are<br />
founded and run in other Men’s Molds, are<br />
always more brittle and looſe than thoſe, that<br />
are forged in a Man’s own Brain. He binds<br />

He does no public Buſineſs without eating and<br />

He diſpatches no public Affair until he has<br />

wiſer, the <em>Italians</em> ſay, after their Bellies are<br />

He is cloathed in Scarlet the Livery of his Sins,<br />

what Means he came to his Wealth and Pre-<br />

comes to be Lord-Mayor he does not keep a<br />

for a whole Year ; for though he invites all the<br />
<em>Companies</em> in the City he does not treat them,<br />

Reckoning beforehand. His Fur-gown makes<br />
him look a great deal bigger than he is, like<br />

yet produces the ſame Effects ; as cold Iron in<br />

which makes him delight, like a Salamander,<br />

Doctrine to be heavenly, becauſe it agrees per-<br />
fectly with the <em>Motus Trepidationis</em>. All his<br />
Hopes are in the <em>Turks</em> overrunning of Chriſ-<br />
tendom, becauſe he has heard they count Fools<br />
and Madmen Saints, and doubts not to paſs<br />
muſter with them for great Abilities that Way.<br />
This makes him believe he can convert the <em>Turk</em>,<br />
tho’ he could do no good on the <em>Pope</em>, or the<br />
<em>Preſbyterian</em>. Nothing comes ſo near his quak-<br />
ing Liturgy, as the Papiſtical Poſſeſſions of the<br />
<em>Devil</em>, with which it conforms in Diſcipline<br />
exact. His Church, or rather Chapel, is built<br />
upon a flat Sand, without ſuperior or inferior<br />
in it, and not upon a Rock, which is never<br />
found without great Inequalities. Next De_<br />
moniacs he moſt reſembles the Reprobate, who<br />
</p>

<p>are ſaid to be condemned to Weeping and<br />
Gnaſhing of Teeth. There was a Botcher of<br />
their Church, that renounced his Trade and<br />
turned Preacher, becauſe he held it ſuperſtiti-<br />
ous to ſit <em>croſs-legged</em>. His Devotion is but a<br />
Kind of ſpiritual Palſy, that proceeds from a<br />
Diſtemper in the Brain, where the Nerves are<br />
rooted. They abhor the Church of <em>England</em>,<br />
but conform exactly with thoſe primitive Fa-<br />
thers of their Church, that heretofore gave An-<br />
ſwers at the <em>Devil</em>’s Oracles, in which they ob-<br />
ſerved the very ſame Ceremony of quaking and<br />
and gaping now practiſed by our modern En_<br />

erciſes of Devotion. He ſucks in the Air like<br />
a Pair of Bellows, and blows his inward Light<br />
