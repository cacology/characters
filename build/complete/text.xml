  writing of Characters was a Kind of
  Wit</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">much in Faſhion in the
  Beginning of the laſt</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Century.
  The two principal Authors in this
  Way</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">were Sir</hi> Thomas
  Overbury, <hi rendition="simple:italic">and Dr.</hi> John<lb />Earle
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Tutor to Prince</hi> Charles
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">in</hi> 1643,

  ſuc-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">ceſſively Biſhop of</hi>
  Worceſter <hi rendition="simple:italic">and</hi> Saliſbury.
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">How</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">agreeable
  theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the
  public</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Taſte may be judged
  from Sir</hi> Thomas’s <hi rendition="simple:italic">little
  Book</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">having fourteen Editions
  before</hi> 1632, <hi rendition="simple:italic">and
  the</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Biſhop’s ſix between</hi>
  1628 <hi rendition="simple:italic">and</hi> 1633.
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Whether</hi><lb />Butler
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">has equalled or excelled them, and
  what</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Place he is to hold in
  this Claſs of Writers muſt</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">be
  left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the
  Inte-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">reſt and Prejudice of a
  Publiſher may render me</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">a

  <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">As in ſuch a Variety of Characters

  <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">As moſt of theſe Characters are dated

  <head>A<lb />HUFFING COURTIER</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>S a Cypher, that has no
  Value himſelf, but<lb />from the Place he ſtands in. All his
  Hap-<lb />pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others<lb />have
  of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-<lb />retical and erroneous,
  though he ſuffer much<lb />Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate,
  and<lb />not to be convinced. He flutters up and down<lb />like a
  Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is<lb />pruning of his Peruque
  takes Occaſion to con-<lb />template his Legs, and the Symmetry of
  his<lb />Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the<lb />Rooms, and
  ſerves for a walking Picture, a<lb />moving Piece of Arras. His
  Buſineſs is only<lb />to be ſeen, and he performs it with
  admirable<lb />Industry, placing himself always in the
  beſt<lb />Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-<lb />tious whom
  he mixes withal. His Occupation<lb />is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if
  they could but<lb />walk themselves, they would ſave him the </p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.<lb />His Immunity from
  Varlets is his Freehold,<lb />and he were a loſt Man without it.
  His<lb />Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he<lb />gives him,
  for ’tis ten to one he never pays for<lb />them. He is very careful to
  diſcover the Lining<lb />of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect
  any<lb />Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the<lb />Skin outwards.
  His Taylor is his Creator,<lb />and makes him of nothing ; and though
  he<lb />lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_<lb />mitting
  Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells<lb />in the Outſide of him,
  like that of a hollow<lb />Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off
  him<lb />he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of<lb />himſelf is the
  wearing of his Cloaths, and,<lb />like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is
  better than<lb />his Body. His looking big is rather a
  Tumor,<lb />than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt<lb />ſo much
  Value, as other Men give him that<lb />believe in him, but none of his
  own. He<lb />makes him Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like<lb />a
  Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get<lb />through. He has juſt
  ſo much of Politics, as<lb />Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Latin</hi>. He is<lb />as humble as a
  Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that<lb />are below
  him ; and with a generous Scorn<lb />deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither
  do him good,<lb />nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do
  him<lb />good, though he knows they never will ; and<lb />deſpiſes
  thoſe, that would not hurt him, if<lb />they could. The Court is his
  Church, and he<lb />believes as that believes, and cries up and
  down<lb />every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a<lb />great
  Comfort to him to think, that ſome who<lb />do not know him may
  perhaps take him for a<lb />Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he
  looks<lb />bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-<lb />tance ;
  and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-<lb />times know you, and
  ſometimes not. Nothing<lb />but want of Money or Credit puts him
  in<lb />mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts<lb />Providence
  that ſomebody will truſt him ; and<lb />in Expectation of that hopes
  for a better Life,<lb />and that his Debts will never riſe up in
  Judg-<lb />ment against him. To get in debt is to labour<lb />in his
  Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his<lb />Protection ; for what’s
  that worth to one that<lb />owes Nothing ? His Employment being only
  to<lb />wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his<lb />Life and
  Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers<lb />Books, that are his faithful
  Hiſtoriographers to<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes<lb />ſo much
  Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;<lb />and that no Man wears his
  Cloaths in Faſhion,<lb />that pays for them, for noting is further
  from<lb />the Mode. He believes that he that runs in<lb />Debt is
  beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,<lb />and only thoſe, that pay,
  are behind. His<lb />Brains are turned giddy, like one that
  walks<lb />on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon<lb />it is ſo
  troubleſome to him to look downwards.<lb />He is a Kind of Spectrum,
  and his Cloaths are<lb />the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ;
  and<lb />when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs<lb />as buſily out
  of one Room into another, as a<lb />great Practiſer does in
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall from<lb />one
  Court to another. When he accoſts a<lb />Lady he puts both Ends of his
  Microcoſm in<lb />Motion, by making Legs at one End, and<lb />combing
  his Peruque at the other. His Gar-<lb />niture is the Sauce to his
  Cloaths, and he walks<lb />in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in
  long<lb />Graſs. Every Motion of him crys
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Vanity
  of</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Vanities, all is
  Vanity,</hi> quoth the Preacher. He<lb />rides himself like a
  well-managed Horſe, reins<lb />in his Neck, and walks
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Terra Terra</hi>. He<lb />carries his
  elbows backward, as if he were<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as<lb />ſtiff as if he was
  upon the Spit. His Legs are<lb />ſtuck in his great voluminous
  Britches, like<lb />the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe
  abundant<lb />Britches, in which his nether Parts are
  not<lb />cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long<lb />in a
  Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now<lb />almoſt worn to Nothing ;
  if it do not recover<lb />quickly it will grown too little for a Head
  of<lb />Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of<lb />his Shoes to
  juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,<lb />or ſuch other Malady, that
  for the Time being<lb />is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When
  he<lb />ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-<lb />men do
  their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons<lb />are of the true Complexion of
  his Mind, a<lb />Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,<lb />that has
  no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-<lb />rows from Reflection. He
  is as tender of his<lb />Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and
  as<lb />loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery<lb />is all his
  Happineſs ; and like <hi rendition="simple:italic">Atlas</hi> he
  carries<lb />his Heaven on his Back. He is like the
  golden<lb />Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He<lb />is a
  Monſter or an <hi rendition="simple:italic">Indian</hi> Creature, that
  is<lb />good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.<lb />He puts
  himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-<lb />dies to play
  upon, who when they have done<lb />with him, let down his
  treble-String, till they<lb />are in the Humour again. His Cook and
  Va-<lb />let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and<lb />him ſo
  punctually together, that the one may<lb />not be ready before the
  other. As Peacocks and<lb />Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt
  Feathers,<lb />yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to
  flutter<lb />only. The Beggars call him
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">my Lord,</hi> and he<lb />takes them at
  their Words, and pays them for<lb />it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo
  true and faith-<lb />ful to the Mode, that he never fails to
  make<lb />you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-<lb />fuſed,
  tho’ you know not what to do with him<lb />when you have
  him.<lb /></p>

  <head>AN<lb />ANTIQUARY</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>S one that has his Being
  in this Age, but<lb />his Life and Converſation is in the Days
  of<lb />old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-<lb />vation, and
  ſlights the future ; but has a great<lb />Value for that, which is
  paſt and gone, like<lb />the Madman, that fell in Love with
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Cleopatra</hi>.<lb />He is an old
  frippery-Philoſopher, that has<lb />ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to
  worm-eaten<lb />Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm<lb />in
  his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and<lb />Fore-mothers, but
  condemns his Parents as<lb />too modern, and no better than Upſtarts.
  He<lb />neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his<lb />own Time,
  and ſo far off Antiquity, which<lb />he ſo much admires ; and repines,
  like a<lb />younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into<lb />the
  World. He ſpends the one half of his<lb />Time in collecting old
  inſignificant Trifles,<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes<lb />ſingular Delight
  in ; becauſe the oftener he does<lb />it, the further they are from
  being new to him.<lb />All his Curiouſities take place of one
  another<lb />according to their Seniority, and he values<lb />them not
  by their Abilities, but their Standing.<lb />He has a great Veneration
  for Words that are<lb />ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged,
  that<lb />they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe<lb />he uſes
  with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-<lb />tiquity, and the good
  Services they have done.<lb />He throws away his Time in enquiring
  after<lb />that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,<lb />like
  one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find<lb />out another that was loſt
  before. He fetches<lb />things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the
  Fable<lb />of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own<lb />Aſhes. He
  values one old Invention, that is<lb />loſt and never to be recovered,
  before all the<lb />new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo
  uſeful.<lb />The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with<lb />his,
  that ſhows the Tombs at
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Westminster</hi>, only<lb />the one does
  it for his Pleaſure, and the other<lb />for Money. As every Man has
  but one Fa-<lb />ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World<lb />of
  Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>for Things that are antient, and the further off<lb />the
  greater.</p>
  <p>He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time<lb />out of Mind, to
  which he conforms exactly,<lb />but is wholly retied from the preſent.
  His<lb />Days were ſpent and gone long before he came<lb />into the
  World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is<lb />to collect what he can out
  of the Ruins of<lb />them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection
  to<lb />any Thing that is old, that he may truly
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">ſay
  to</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Duſt and Worms you are my
  Father, and to Rot-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">tenneſs
  thou are my Mother</hi>. He has no Provi-<lb />dence nor Fore-ſight ;
  for all his Contempla-<lb />tions look backward upon the Days of
  old,<lb />and his Brains are turned with them, as if he<lb />walked
  backwards. He had rather interpret<lb />one obſcure Word in any old
  ſenſeleſs Diſ-<lb />courſe, than be the Author of the moſt
  ingenious<lb />new one ; and with
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Scaliger</hi> would ſell the<lb />Empire
  of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Germany</hi><note>

    [<hi rendition="simple:italic">footnote cont. next
    page</hi>][^2]</p>
  </note> (if it were in his Power)<lb />for an old Song. He devours an
  old Manuſ-<lb />cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and
  Moths<lb />do, and, though there be nothing in it, values<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>it above any Thing printed, which he accounts<lb />but a Novelty.
  When he happens to cure a<lb />ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as
  proud<lb />of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,<lb />and
  could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.<lb />He values things
  wrongfully upon their Anti-<lb />quity, forgetting that the moſt
  modern are<lb />really the moſt ancient of all Things in
  the<lb />World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds<lb />before their
  Shillings and Pence, of which they<lb />are made up. He eſteems no
  Cuſtoms but ſuch<lb />as have outlived themſelves, and are long
  ſince<lb />out of Uſe ; as the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Catholics</hi> allow of no
  Saints,<lb />but ſuch as are dead, and the

  none but the Living.<lb /></p>

  <head>A<lb />PROUD MAN</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>S a Fool in Fermentation,
  that ſwells and<lb />boils over like a Porridge-Pot. He ſets
  out<lb />his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem<lb />bigger than
  he is. He is troubled with a Tu-<lb />mour and Inflammation of
  Self-Conceit, that<lb />renders every Part of him ſtiff and
  uneaſy.<lb />He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-<lb />der, that
  works upon him to Dotage, and has<lb />transformed him into his own
  Miſtreſs. He<lb />is his own Gallant, and makes moſt
  paſſionate<lb />Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections. He<lb />commits
  Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips<lb />his own Image ; though there is
  no Soul living<lb />of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes
  as<lb />the Church believes, and maintains his Faith<lb />with the
  Obſtinacy of a <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fanatic.</hi> He is his
  own<lb />Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above<lb />his Merit,
  but all Mankind ; is both
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Damon</hi><lb />and
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pythias</hi> to his own dear ſelf, and
  values his<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>Crony above his Soul. He gives Place to no<lb />Man but himſelf,
  and that with very great<lb />Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems
  not<lb />worthy to approach him. He believes what-<lb />ſoever he has
  receives a Value in being his ;<lb />as a Horſe in a Nobleman’s Stable
  will bear a<lb />greater Price than in a common Market. He<lb />is ſo
  proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted<lb />with himſelf as with
  others ; for he is very<lb />apt to forget who he is, and knows
  himſelf<lb />only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats
  himſelf<lb />civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and
  Com-<lb />pliment, but admits of no Privacy. He ſtrives<lb />to look
  bigger than himſelf, as well as others,<lb />and is no better than his
  own Paraſite and<lb />Flatterer. A little Flood will make a
  ſhallow<lb />Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and<lb />foam,
  and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep<lb />ſilent Stream glides
  quietly on. So a vain-<lb />glorious inſolent proud Man ſwells with a
  little<lb />frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-<lb />flows
  his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves<lb />Mud and Dirt behind him.
  His Carriage is<lb />as glorious and haughty, as if he were
  advan-<lb />ced upon Men’s Shoulders, or tumbled over<lb />their Heads
  like Knipperdolling. He fancies </p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head<lb />holds no
  Proportion to his Body, and his foun-<lb />dation is leſſer than his
  upper Stories. We<lb />can naturally take no view of our ſelves,
  un-<lb />leſs we look downwards, to teach us how<lb />humble Admirers
  we ought to be of our own<lb />Values. The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his
  Mate-<lb />rials are, the more Room they take up, and<lb />make him
  ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and<lb />Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions

  perpe-<lb />tual Apologies, Excuſes, and Defences, but<lb />ſtill by
  Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-<lb />fling Strain, without Regard
  of any Man,<lb />that ſtands in the Way of his Pageant.<lb />Where he

  <p>Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form<lb />of juſt Wit, are

  crys down all they do, as if they<lb />were Encroachments upon him. He
  takes<lb />Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them,
  as<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Justices</hi> do falſe Weights,
  and Pots that want<lb />Meaſure. When he meets with any
  Thing,<lb />that is very good, he changes it into ſmall<lb />Money,
  like three Groats for a Shilling, to<lb />ſerve ſeveral Occaſions. He
  diſclaims Study,<lb />pretends to take Things in Motion, and to
  ſhoot<lb />flying, which appears to be very true by his<lb />often
  miſſing of his Mark. His Wit is much<lb />troubled with Obſtructions ;
  and he has Fits as<lb />painful as thoſe of the Spleen. He fancies

  <p>When he writes, he commonly ſteers the<lb />Senſe of his Lines by

  willing<lb />to take it. He had rather ſell bad Wine, than<lb />good
  that ſtands him in no more, for it makes<lb />Men ſooner drunk, and
  then they are the eaſier<lb />over-reckoned. By the Knaveries he
  acts<lb />above-board, which every Man ſees, one may<lb />eaſily take
  a Meaſure of thoſe he does under<lb />Ground in his Cellar ; for he
  that will pick<lb />a Man’s Pocket to his Face, will not ſtick
  to<lb />uſe him worſe in private when he knows no-<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>thing of it. When he has poiſoned his<lb />Wines he raiſes his
  Price, and to make amends<lb />for that abates his Meaſure, for he
  thinks it<lb />a greater Sin to commit Murder for ſmall<lb />Gains,
  than a valuable Conſideration. He<lb />does not only ſpoil and deſtroy
  his Wines, but<lb />an ancient reverend Proverb, with brewing
  and<lb />racking, that ſays, <hi rendition="simple:italic">In vino
  veritas</hi>, for there<lb />is no Truth in his, but all falſe and
  ſophiſtica-<lb />ted ; for he can counterfeit Wine as
  cunningly<lb />as <hi rendition="simple:italic">Apelles</hi> did
  Grapes, and cheat Men with it,<lb />as
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">he</hi> did Birds. He brings every
  Bottle of<lb />Wine he draws to the

  Cheat, and afterwards puts himſelf upon<lb />the Mercy of the Company.
  He is an
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Anti-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">chriſtian</hi>
  Cheat ; for Chriſt turned Water into<lb />Wine, and he turns Wine into
  Water. He<lb />ſcores all his Reckonings upon two Tables<lb />made
  like thoſe of the ten Commandments, that<lb />he may be put in Mind to
  break them as oft as<lb />poſſibly he can ; eſpecially that of
  ſtealing and<lb />bearing falſe Witneſs againſt his
  Neighbour,<lb />when he draws him bad Wine and ſwears it is<lb />good,
  and that he can take more for the Pipe<lb />than the Wine will yield
  him by the Bottle,<lb />a Trick that a
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Jesuit</hi> taught him to cheat
  his<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>own Conſcience with. When he is found to<lb />over-reckon
  notoriouſly, he has one common<lb />Evaſion for all, and that is to
  ſay it was a<lb />Miſtake, by which he means, that he
  thought<lb />they had not been ſober enough to diſcover it ;<lb />for
