Astrologer

I^2^<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">s</span> one that expounds upon the Planets, and\
teaches to conſtrue the *Accidents*  by the *due\
joining of Stars in Conſtruction.* He talks with\
them by dumb Signs, and can tell what they\
mean by their twinckling, and ſquinting upon\
one another, as well as they themſelves.  He\
is a Spy upon the Stars, and can tell what they\
are doing, by the Company they keep, and the\
Houſes they frequent. They have no Power to\
do any Thing alone, until ſo many meet, as\
will make a *Quorum.*He is Clerk of the Com-\
mittee to them, and draws up all their Orders,\
that concern either public or private Affairs.\
He keeps all their Accompts for them, and\
ſums them up, not by *Debtor,* but by *Creditor*\
alone, a more compendious Way. They do\
ill to make them have ſo much Authority over\

the Earth, which, perhaps, has as much as\
any one of them but the Sun, and as much\
Right to ſit and vote in their Councils, as any\
other : But becauſe there are but ſeven Electors\
of the *German* Empire, they will allow of no\
more to diſpoſe of all other ; and moſt fooliſhly\
and unnaturally depoſe their own Parent of its\
Inheritance; rather than acknowledge a Defect\
in their own Rules.  Theſe Rules are all they\
have to ſhew for their Title ; and yet not one\
of them can tell whether thoſe they had them\
from came honeſtly by them.  *Virgil's* Deſ-\
cription of *Fame,* that reaches from Earth\
to the Stars, *tam ficti pravique tenax,* to carry\
Lies and Knavery, will ſerve Aſtrologers with-\
out any ſenſible Variation.  He is a Fortune-\
Seller, a Retailer of Deſtiny, and petty Chap-\
man to the Planets.  He caſts Nativities as\
Gameſters do falſe Dice, and by ſlurring and\
palming *ſextile, quartile,* and *trine,* like *ſize,*\
*quater, trois,* can throw what chance he\
pleaſes.  He ſets a Figure, as Cheats do a Main\
at Hazard ; and Gulls throw away their Money\
at it.  He festches the Grounds of his Art ſo\
far off, as well from Reaſon, as the Stars, that,\
like a Traveller, he is allowed to lye by Au-\

thority.  And as Beggars, that have no Money\
themſelves, believe all others have, and beg\
of thoſe, that have as little as themſelves : So\
the ignorant Rabble believe in him, though\
he has no more Reaſon for what he profeſſes,\
than they.\
