QUAKER

I^2^S a Scoundrel Saint, of an Order without\
Founder, Vow, or Rule ; for he will not\
ſwear, nor be tyed to any Thing, but his own\
Humour.  He is the Link-Boy of the Sectaries,\
and talks much of his Light, but puts it under\
a Buſhel, for nobody can ſee it but himſelf.  His\
Religion is but the cold Fit of an Ague, and his\
Zeal of a contrary Temper to that of all others,\
yet produces the ſame Effects ; as cold Iron in\
*Greenland*, they ſay, burns as well as hot ;\
which makes him delight, like a Salamander,\
to live in the Fire of Perſecution.  He works\
out his Salvation, not with *Fear*, but *Confidence*\
*and Trembling*.  His Profeſſion is but a Kind\
of Winter-Religion ; and the Original of it as\
uncertain as the hatching of Woodcocks, for\
no Man can tell from whence it came.  He\
Vapours much of the Light within him, but\
no ſuch Thing appears, unleſs he means as he\


---


is light-headed.  He believes he takes up the\
Croſs in being croſs to all Mankind.  He de_\
lights in Perſecution, as ſome old extravagant\
Fornicators find a Lechery in being whipt ;\
and has no Ambition but to go to Heaven in\
what he calls a fiery Chariot, that is, a Wood-\
monger’s Faggot Cart.  You may perceive he\
has a Crack in his Skill by the flat Twang of\
his Noſe, and the great Care he takes to keep\
his Hat on, leſt his ſickly Brains, if he have\
any, ſhould take Cold at it.  He believes his\
Doctrine to be heavenly, becauſe it agrees per-\
fectly with the *Motus Trepidationis*.  All his\
Hopes are in the *Turks* overrunning of Chriſ-\
tendom, becauſe he has heard they count Fools\
and Madmen Saints, and doubts not to paſs\
muſter with them for great Abilities that Way.\
This makes him believe he can convert the *Turk*,\
tho’ he could do no good on the *Pope*, or the\
*Preſbyterian*.  Nothing comes ſo near his quak-\
ing Liturgy, as the Papiſtical Poſſeſſions of the\
*Devil*, with which it conforms in Diſcipline\
exact.  His Church, or rather Chapel, is built\
upon a flat Sand, without ſuperior or inferior\
in it, and not upon a Rock, which is never\
found without great Inequalities.  Next De_\
moniacs he moſt reſembles the Reprobate, who\


---


are ſaid to be condemned to Weeping and\
Gnaſhing of Teeth.  There was a Botcher of\
their Church, that renounced his Trade and\
turned Preacher, becauſe he held it ſuperſtiti-\
ous to ſit *croſs-legged*.  His Devotion is but a\
Kind of ſpiritual Palſy, that proceeds from a\
Diſtemper in the Brain, where the Nerves are\
rooted.  They abhor the Church of *England*,\
but conform exactly with thoſe primitive Fa-\
theres of their Church, that heretofore gave An-\
ſwers at the *Devil*’s Oracles, in which they ob-\
ſerved the very ſame Ceremony of quaking and\
and gaping now practiſed by our modern En_\
thuſiaſts at their Exorciſms, rather than Ex-\
erciſes of Devotion.  He ſucks in the Air like\
a Pair of Bellows, and blows his inward Light\
with it, till he dung Fire, as Cattle do in *Lin*-\
*colnſhire*.  The general Ignorance of their\
whole Party make it appear, that whatſoever\
their Zeal may be, it is not *according to Know*-\
*ledge*.\
