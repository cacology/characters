[*two rules*]#An\Imitator^I^s a counterfeit Stone, and the larger and\fairer he appears the more apt he is to be\diſcovered, whilſt ſmall ones, that pretend tono great Value, paſs unſuſpected.

He is like a Spectrum or walking\Spirit that aſſumes the Shape of ſome particular\Peſson, and appears in the Likeneſs of ſome-\thing that he is not, becauſe he has no Shape\of his own to put on.
