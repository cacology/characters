[*two rules*]#A\QUIBBLERI^2^s a Jugler of Words, that ſhows Tricks\with them, to make them appear what they\were not meant for, and ſerve two Senſes at\once, like one that plays on two *fews* Trumps. \He is a Fencer of Language, that falſiſies his\Blow, and hits where he did not aim. He\Has a fooliſh Slight of Wit, that catches at\Words only, and lets the Senſe go, like the\young Thief in the Farce, that took a Purſe, \but gave the Owner his Money back again. \He is ſo well verſed in all Cafes of Quibble,\that he knows when there will be a Blot upon\a Word, as ſoon as it is out. He packs his\Quibbles like a Stock of Cards, let him but\ſhuffle, and cut where you will, he will be\ſure to have it.  He dances on a Rope of Sand,\does the *Somerſet*, *Strapado*, and half-ſlrapado\with Words, plays at all manner of Games\

with *Clinches*, *Carwickets*, and *Quibbles*, and\talks *under-Leg*. His Wit is left-handed, and\therefore what others mean for right, he ap-\prehends quite contrary. All his Conceptions\are produced by equivocal Generation, which\makes them juſtly eſteemed but Maggots. He\rings the Changes upon Words, and is ſo ex-\pert, that he can tell at firſt Sight, how\many Variations any Number of Words will\bear. He talks with a *Trillo*, and gives his\Words a double Reliſh. He had rather have\them bear two Senſes in vain and impertinent-\ly, than one to the Purpoſe, and never ſpeaks\without a Lere-Senſe. He talks nothing but\Equivocation and mental Reſervation, and\mightily affects to give a Word a double Stroke, \like a Tennis-Ball againſt two Walls at one\Blow, to defeat the Expectation of his An-\tagonift. He commonly ſlurs every fourth or\fifth Word, and ſeldom fails to throw Dou-\blets. There are two Sorts of Quibbling, the\one with Words, and the other with Senſe, \like the Rhetoricians *Figurae Dictionis & Figurae*\*Senteniae* — The firſt is already cried down,\[^1]: *Without a Lefe-Serſe] A Lere-Sterſe* is a ſecond or supernume-\rary Scale, as a Led-Horſe was formerly called a Lere-Harſe, \See *Bailey’s* Dictionary. \

and the other as yet prevails; and is the only\Elegance of our modern Poets, which eaſy\Judges call *Eaſineſs*; but having nothing in it\But *Eaſineſs*, and being never uſed by any laſt-\ing Wit, will in wiſer Times fall to nothing of\itſselſ. \
