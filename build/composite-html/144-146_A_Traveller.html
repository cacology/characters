<p>[I]s a Native of all Countries, and an Alien at<br />
[I]Home. He flies from the Place where he<br />
was hatched, like a Wildgoos<em>e, and prefers all<br />
others before it. He has no Quarrel to it, but<br />
becaus</em>e he was born in it, and like a Bas<em>tard,<br />
he is as</em>hamed of his Mother, becaus<em>e s</em>he is of<br />
him. He is a Merchant, that makes Voyages<br />
into foreign Nations, to drive a Trade in Wis<em>-<br />
dom and Politics, and it is not for his Credit<br />
to have it thought, he has made an ill Return,<br />
which mus</em>t be, if he s<em>hould allow of any of<br />
the Growth of his own Country. This makes<br />
him quick and blow up hims</em>elf with Admira-<br />
tion of foreign Parts, and a generous Con-<br />
tempt of Home, that all Men may admire, at<br />
leas<em>t, the means he has had of Improvement,<br />
and deplore their own Defects</em>. His Obs<em>erva-<br />
tions are like a Sieve, that lets the finer Flour<br />
pas</em>s, and retains only the Bran of Things;<br />

he will never be able to put off. He believes<br />
all Men's Wits are at a s<em>tand, that s</em>tay at<br />
Home, and only thos<em>e advanced, that travel ;<br />
as if Change of Pas</em>ture did make great Politi-<br />

knowledge of Truth which thos<em>e have, that<br />

that at the s<em>ame time he tells us, how little<br />
Credit is to be given to his own Relations and<br />
thos</em>e of others, that s<em>peak and write of their<br />
Travels. He has worn his own Language to<br />
Rags, and patched it up with Scraps and Ends<br />
of foreign--This s</em>erves him for Wit, and they ap-<br />

hold with Men, he falls among the Number<br />
of the latter, and his Improvements are little<br />
to his Credit. All he can s<em>ay for hims</em>elf is,<br />
his Mind was s<em>ick of a Cons</em>umption, and<br />
change of Air has cured him : For all his other<br />
Improvements have only been to eat in . . . .<br />
and talk with thos<em>e he did not unders</em>tand; to<br />
hold Intelligence with all Gazettes, and from<br />
the Sight of States<em>men in the Street unriddle<br />
the Intrigues of all their Councils, to make a<br />
wondrous Progres</em>s into Knowledge by riding<br />
with a Mes<em>s</em>enger, and advance In Politics by<br />
mounting of a Mule, run through all Sorts of<br />
Learning in a Waggon, and found all Depths<br />
of Arts in Felucca, ride pos<em>t into the Secrets<br />
of all States, and grow acquainted with their<br />

Hedges to make an able Man, and a good<br />
