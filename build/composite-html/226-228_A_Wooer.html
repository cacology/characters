<p>WOOER</p>
<p>S<sup>2</sup>TANDS Candidate for Cuckold, and if<br />
he miſs of it, it is none of his Fault; for<br />
his Merit is ſuſſiciently known. He is com<br />
monly no Lover, but able to paſs for a moſt<br />
deſperate one, where he finds it is like to prove<br />
of conſiderable Advantage to him; and there-<br />
fore has Paſſions lying by him of all Sizes pro-<br />
portionable to all Women’s Fortunes, and can<br />
be indifferent, melancholy, or ſtark-mad, ac-<br />
cording as their Eſtates give him Occaſion; and<br />
when he finds it is to no Purpoſe, can preſently<br />
come to himſelf again, and try another. He  proſecutes his Suit againſt his Miſtreſs as Clients<br />
do a Suit in Law, and does nothing without<br />
the Advice of his learned Council, omits no<br />
Advantage for want of ſoliciting, and, when<br />
He gets her Conſent, overthrows her. He en-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>deavors to match his Eſtate, rather than him-<br />
ſelſ, to the beſt Advantage, and is his Miſ-<br />
treſs’s Fortune and his do but come to an<br />
Agreement, their Perſons are eaſily ſatisſied, the<br />
Match is ſoon made up, and a Croſs Marriage<br />
between all four is prefeſtly concluded. He is<br />
not much concerned in his Lady’s Virtues, for if<br />
the Opinion of the <em>Stoics</em> be true, <em>that the vir-</em><br />
<em>tuous are always rich</em>, there is no doubt, but ſhe<br />
that is rich muſt be virtuous. He never goes<br />
without a Liſt in his Pocket of all the Widows<br />
and Virgins about the Town, with Particulars<br />
of their Jointures, Portions, and Inheritances,<br />
that if one miſs he may not be without a Re-<br />
ſerve; for he eſteems <em>Cupid</em> very improvident,<br />
if he has not more than two Strings to his<br />
Bow. When he wants a better Introduction,<br />
he begins his Addreſſes to the Chamber-maid,<br />
like one that ſues the Tenant to eject the Land-<br />
lord, and according as he thrives there makes<br />
his Approaches to the Miſtreſs. He can tell<br />
readily what the Difference is between Join-<br />
Ture with Tution of Infant, Land and<br />
Money of any Value, and what the Odds is<br />
to a Penny between them all, either to take or<br />
leave. He does not ſo much go a wooing as<br />
put in his Claim, as if all Men of Fortune<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>had a fair Title to all Women of the ſame<br />
Quality, and therefore are ſaid to demand them<br />
in Marriage. But if he be a Wooer of For-<br />
tune, that deſigns to raiſe himſelſ by it, he<br />
makes wooing his Vocation, deals with all<br />
Matchmakers, that are his Setters, is very<br />
painful in his Calling, and, if he Buſineſs ſucceed,<br />
ſteals her away and commits Matri-<br />
mony with a ſelonious Intent. He has a great<br />
deſire to beget Money on the Body of a Wo-<br />
man, and as for other Iſſue is very indifferent,<br />
and cares not how old ſhe be, ſo ſhe be not paſt<br />
Money-bearing.<br />
