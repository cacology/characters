<h1 id="a-proud-man">A<br />
PROUD MAN</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S a Fool in Fermentation, that ſwells and<br />
boils over like a Porridge-Pot. He ſets out<br />
his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem<br />
bigger than he is. He is troubled with a Tu-<br />
mour and Inflammation of Self-Conceit, that<br />
renders every Part of him ſtiff and uneaſy.<br />
He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-<br />
der, that works upon him to Dotage, and has<br />
transformed him into his own Miſtreſs. He<br />
is his own Gallant, and makes moſt paſſionate<br />
Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections. He<br />
commits Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips<br />
his own Image ; though there is no Soul living<br />
of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes as<br />
the Church believes, and maintains his Faith<br />
with the Obſtinacy of a <em>Fanatic.</em> He is his own<br />
Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above<br />
his Merit, but all Mankind ; is both <em>Damon</em><br />
and <em>Pythias</em> to his own dear ſelf, and values his<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Crony above his Soul. He gives Place to no<br />
Man but himſelf, and that with very great<br />
Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems not<br />
worthy to approach him. He believes what-<br />
ſoever he has receives a Value in being his ;<br />
as a Horſe in a Nobleman’s Stable will bear a<br />
greater Price than in a common Market. He<br />
is ſo proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted<br />
with himſelf as with others ; for he is very<br />
apt to forget who he is, and knows himſelf<br />
only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats himſelf<br />
civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and Com-<br />
pliment, but admits of no Privacy. He ſtrives<br />
to look bigger than himſelf, as well as others,<br />
and is no better than his own Paraſite and<br />
Flatterer. A little Flood will make a ſhallow<br />
Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and<br />
foam, and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep<br />
ſilent Stream glides quietly on. So a vain-<br />
glorious inſolent proud Man ſwells with a little<br />
frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-<br />
flows his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves<br />
Mud and Dirt behind him. His Carriage is<br />
as glorious and haughty, as if he were advan-<br />
ced upon Men’s Shoulders, or tumbled over<br />
their Heads like Knipperdolling. He fancies </p>
<hr />
<p>himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head<br />
holds no Proportion to his Body, and his foun-<br />
dation is leſſer than his upper Stories. We<br />
can naturally take no view of our ſelves, un-<br />
leſs we look downwards, to teach us how<br />
humble Admirers we ought to be of our own<br />
Values. The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his Mate-<br />
rials are, the more Room they take up, and<br />
make him ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and<br />
Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions better than Things<br />
of more cloſe and ſolid Parts.<br />
