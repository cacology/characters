<h1 id="an-alderman">AN<br />
ALDERMAN</h1>
<p>H<sup>2</sup>AS taken his Degree in Cheating, and<br />
the higheſt of his Faculty ; or paid for<br />
refuſing his <em>MANDAMUS</em>. He is a Peer of the<br />
City, and a Member of their upper Houſe,<br />
Who, as ſoon as he arrives at ſo many thouſand<br />
Pounds, is bound by the Charter to ſerve the<br />
Public with ſo much Underſtanding, what<br />
ſhift ſoever he make to raiſe it, and wear a<br />
Chain about his Neck like a Raindeer, or in<br />
Default to commute, and make Satisfaction in<br />
ready Money, the beſt Reaſon of the Place;<br />
for which hi has the Name only, like a titular<br />
Prince, and is an <em>Alderman extraordinary</em>. But<br />
if his Wife can prevail with him to ſtand, he<br />
becomes one of the City-ſupporters, and, like<br />
the Unicorn in the King's Arms, wears a Chain<br />
about his Neck very right-worſhipfully. He<br />
wears Scarlet, as the Whore of <em>Babylon</em> does,<br />
not for her honeſty, but the Rank and Quality<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>ſhe is of among the Wicked, When he ſits<br />
as a Judge in his Court he is abſolute, and uſes<br />
arbitrary Power ; for he is not bound to un-<br />
derſtand what he does, nor render an Account<br />
why he gives Judgment on one Side rather<br />
than another ; but his Will is ſufficient to ſtand<br />
for his Reaſon, to all Intents and Purpoſes.<br />
He does no public Buſineſs without eating and<br />
drinking, and never meets about Matters of Im-<br />
portance, but the Cramming his Inſide is the<br />
moſt weighty Part of the Work of the Day.<br />
He diſpatches no public Affair until he has<br />
thoroughly dined upon it, and is fully ſatisfied<br />
with Quince-Pye and Cuſtard : for Men are<br />
wiſer, the <em>Italians</em> ſay, after their Bellies are<br />
full, than when they are faſting, and he is very<br />
cautious to omit no Occaſion of improving his<br />
Parts that Way. He is ſo careful of the In-<br />
tereſt of his Belly, and manages it ſo induſ-<br />
triouſly, that in a little Space it grows great<br />
and takes Place of all the reſt of his Members,<br />
and becomes ſo powerful, that they will never<br />
be in a Condition to rebel againſt it any more.<br />
He is cloathed in Scarlet the Livery of his Sins,<br />
like the rich Glutton, to put him in Mind of<br />
what Means he came to his Wealth and Pre-<br />
ferment by. He makes a Trade of his Eat-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>ing, and, like a Cock, ſcrapes when he feeds ;<br />
for the Public pays for all and more, which he<br />
and his Brethren ſhare among themſelves ; for<br />
they never make a dry Reckoning. When he<br />
comes to be Lord-Mayor he does not keep a<br />
great Houſe, but a very great Houſe-warming<br />
for a whole Year ; for though he invites all the<br />
<em>Companies</em> in the City he does not treat them,<br />
but they club to entertain him, and pay the<br />
Reckoning beforehand. His Fur-gown makes<br />
him look a great deal bigger than he is, like<br />
the Feathers of an Owl, and when he pulls<br />
it off, he looks as if he were fallen away, or<br />
like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.<br />
