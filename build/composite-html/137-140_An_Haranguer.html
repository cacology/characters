<p>[I]s one, that is s<em>o delighted with the s</em>weet/ [I] Sound of his own Tongue, that [i] William<br />
Prynne [i] will s<em>ooner lend an Ear, than he, to any<br />
Thing els</em>e. His Meas<em>ure of Talk is till his<br />
Wind is s</em>pent; and then he is not s<em>ilenced,<br />
but becalmed. His Ears have catched the<br />
Itch of his Tonuge, and though he s</em>cratch<br />
them, like a Beas<em>t with his Hoof, he finds a<br />
Pleas</em>ure in it. A [i] s<em>ilenced Minis</em>ter, [i] has more<br />
Mercy on the Government in a s<em>ecure Conven-<br />
ticle, than he has on the Company, that he is<br />
in. He s</em>hakes a Man by the Ear, as a Dog<br />
does a Pig, and never loos<em>es his Hold, till he<br />
has tired hims</em>elf, as well as his Patient. He<br />
does not talk to a Man, but attack him, and<br />
whoms<em>oever he can get into his Hands he lays<br />
violent Language on. If he can he will run<br />
a Man up agains</em>t a Wall, and hold him at a<br />

Bay by the Buttons, which he handles as bad<br />
as he does his Pers<em>on, or the Bus</em>ines<em>s he treats<br />
upon. When he finds him begin to s</em>ink, he<br />
holds him by the Cloaths, and feels him as a<br />
Butcher does a Calf, before he kills him. He<br />
is a walking Pillory, and crucifies more Ears<br />
than a dozen s<em>tanding ones. He will hold any<br />
Argument rather than his Tongue, and main-<br />
tain both s</em>ides at his own Charge; for he will<br />
tell you what you will s<em>ay, though, perhaps,<br />
he does not intend to give you leave. He<br />
lugs Men by the Ears, as they correct Children<br />
in [i] Scotland, [i] and will make them tingle, while<br />
he talks with them, as s</em>ome s<em>ay they will do,<br />
when a Man is talked of in his Abs</em>ence. When<br />
he talks to a Man, he comes up clos<em>e to him,<br />
and like an old Solider lets fly in his Face, or<br />
claps the Bore of his Pis</em>tol to his Ear, and<br />
whispers aloud, that he may be s<em>ure not to<br />
mis</em>s his Mark. His tongue is always in Mo-<br />
tion, tho very s<em>eldom to the Purpos</em>e, like a<br />
Barber's Scis<em>s</em>ers, which are always s<em>nipping,<br />
as well when they do not cut, as when they<br />
do. His Tongue is like a Bagpipe Drone, that<br />
has no Stop, but makes a continual ugly Nois</em>e,<br />
hims*elf. He never leaves a Man until he has<br />

run him down, and then he winds a Death<br />
over him. A Sow-Gelder's Horn is not s<em>o<br />
terrible to Dogs and Cats, as he is to all that<br />
know him. His Way of Argument is to talk<br />
all, and hear to Contradiction. Firs</em>t he gives<br />
his Antagonis<em>t the Length of the Wind, and<br />
then, let him make his Approaches if he can,<br />
he is s</em>ure to be beforehand with him. Of all<br />
dis<em>s</em>olute Dis<em>eas</em>es the Running of the Tongue is<br />
the wors<em>t, and the hardes</em>t to be cured. If he<br />
happen at any time to be at a Stand, and any<br />
Man els<em>e begins to s</em>peak, he pres<em>ently drowns<br />
him with his Nois</em>e, as a Water-Dog makes a<br />
Duck dive: for when you think he has done<br />

will dis<em>charge nine Times with one Loading.<br />
He is a Rattles</em>nake, that with his Nois<em>e gives<br />
Men warning to avoid him, otherwis</em>e he will<br />

like common Fame, that s<em>peaks mos</em>t and<br />
knows leas<em>t, Lord [i] Brooks, [i] or a Wildgoos</em>e al-<br />

His Tongue is like any Kind of Carriage, the<br />
