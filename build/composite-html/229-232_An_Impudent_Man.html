<h1 id="an-impudent-man-1">An<br />
Impudent Man</h1>
<p><sup>I</sup>s one, whoſe want of Money and want of<br />
Wit have engaged him beyond his Abilities.<br />
The little Knowledge he has of himſelf being<br />
ſuitable to the little he has in his Profeſſion has<br />
Made him believe himſelf fit for it. This double<br />
Ignorance has made him ſet a Value upon him-<br />
ſelf, as he that wants a great deal appears in a<br />
better Condition, than he that wants a little.<br />
This renders him confident, and fit for any<br />
Undertaking, and ſometimes (ſuch is the con-<br />
current Ignorance of the World) he proſpers<br />
In it, but oftner miſcarries, and becomes ri-<br />
diculous; yet this Advantage he has, that as<br />
nothing can make him ſee his Error, ſo he is<br />
fortified with his Ignorance, as barren and<br />
rocky Places are by their Situation, and he will<br />
rather believe that all Men want Judgment,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>than himſelf. For as no Man is pleaſed, that<br />
has an ill Opinion of himſelſ, Nature, that<br />
finds out Remedies herſelf, and his own Eaſe<br />
render him indefenſible of his Defects¬—From<br />
hence he grows impudent; for as Men judge<br />
by Compariſon, he knows as little what it is<br />
To be defective, as what it is to be excellent.<br />
Nothing renders Men modeſt, but a juſt Know-<br />
ledge how to compare themſelves with others;<br />
and where that is wanting, Impudence supplies<br />
the Place of it: for there is no Vacuum in the<br />
Minds of Men, and commonly, like other<br />
Things in Nature, they ſwell more with Rare-<br />
faction than Condenſation. The more Men<br />
know of the World, the worſe Opinion they<br />
have of it; and the more they underſtand of<br />
Truth, they are better acquainted with the<br />
Difficulties of it, and conſsequently are the leſs<br />
confident in their Aſſertions, eſpecially in mat-<br />
ters of Probability, which commonly is ſquint-<br />
ey’d, and looks nine Ways at once. It is the<br />
Office of a juſt Judge to hear both Parties, and<br />
he that conſiders but the one Side of Things<br />
can never make a juſt Judgment, though he<br />
may by Chance a true one. Impudence is the<br />
Baſtard of Ignorance, not only unlawfully,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>but inceſtouſsly begotten by a Man upon his<br />
own Underſtanding, and laid by himſelſ at<br />
his own Door, a Monſter of unnatural Pro-<br />
duction; for Shame is as much the Propriety<br />
of human Nature (though overſeen by the<br />
Philoſsophers) and perhaps more than Reaſon,<br />
Laughing, or looking aſquint, by which they<br />
diſtinguish Man from Beaſts; and the leſs<br />
Men have of it, the nearer they approach to<br />
the Nature of Brutes. Modeſty is but a noble<br />
Jealouſy of Honour, and Impudence the Proſ-<br />
titution of it; for he, whoſe Face is proof<br />
againſt Infamy, muſt be as little ſenſible of<br />
Glory. His Forehead, like a voluntary Cuck-<br />
old’s is by his Horns made Proof againſt a<br />
Bluſh. Nature made Man barefaced, and civil<br />
Cuſtom has preſerved him ſo; but he that’s im-<br />
pudent does wear a Vizard more ugly and de-<br />
formed than Highway Thieves diſguiſe them-<br />
ſelves with. Shame is the tender moral Con-<br />
ſcience of good Men. When there is a Crack<br />
In the Skull, Nature herſelf with a tough horny<br />
Callus repairs the Breach; ſo a flaw’d Intellect is with a brawny Callus Face ſupplied. The<br />
Face is the Dial of the Mind; and where they<br />
Do not go together, ‘tis a Sign, that one or<br />
Both are out of Order. He that is impudent<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>is like a Merchant, that trades upon his Cre-<br />
dit without a Stock, and if his Debts were<br />
known, would break immediately. The Inſide<br />
of his Head is like the Outſide; and his Peruke<br />
as naturally of his own Growth, as his Wit.<br />
He paſſes in the World like a Piece of Counter-<br />
feit Coin, looks well enough until he is rubbed<br />
and worn with Uſe, and then his Copper Com-<br />
plexion begins to appear, and nobody will take<br />
Him, but by Owl-light.</p>
