<p>[I]s one that takes the s<em>ame Cours</em>e, that the<br />
<a href="i">I</a>Devil (i) did in Paradis<em>e, he begins with the<br />
Woman. He Des</em>pis<em>es all other (i)Fanatics (i) as Up-<br />
s</em>tarts, and values hims<em>elf upon his Antiquity.<br />
He is a Man-Midwife to the Soul, and is all<br />
his Life-time in this World deluding it to the<br />
next. (i) Christ (i) made St. (i) Peter (i) a Fis</em>her of Men ;<br />
but he believe it better to be a Fis<em>her of Wo-<br />
men, and s</em>o becomes a Woman's Apos<em>tle.<br />
His Profes</em>s<em>ion is to dis</em>guise hims<em>elf, which he<br />
does in Sheeps-Cloathing, that is, a Lay Habit ;<br />
but whether, as a Wolf, a Thief or a Shep-<br />
herd, is a great Question ; only this is certain,<br />
that he had rather have one Sheep out of ano-<br />
ther Man's Fold, that two out of his own.<br />
He gathers his Church as (i) Fantaics do, yet des</em>-<br />
pis<em>es them for it, and keeps his Flock always in<br />
Hurdles, to be removed at his Pleas</em>ure ; and<br />
though their Souls be rotten or s*cabby with<br />

Hypocris<em>y, the Fleece is s</em>ure to be s<em>ound and<br />
orthodox. He tars their Cons</em>ciences with<br />
Confes<em>s</em>ion and Penance, but always keeps the<br />
Wool, that he pulls from the Sore, to hims<em>elf.<br />
He never makes a Pos</em>clyte, but he (i) converts (i)<br />
him to his very Shirt, and (i) turns (i) his Pockets<br />
into the Bargain ; for he does nothing unles<em>s<br />
his Purs</em>e prove a good (i) Catholic. (i) He never gets<br />
within a Family, but he gets on the Top of it,<br />
and governs all down to the Bottom of the<br />
Cellar--He will not tolerate the Scullion un-<br />
les<em>s he be othrodox, nor allow of the turning<br />
of the Spit, but (i) in ordine ad Spiritualia. (i) His<br />
(i) Dominion is not founded in Grace, (i) but Sin ; for he<br />
keeps his Subjects in perfect Awe by being<br />
acquainted with their mos</em>t s<em>acred Iniquities,<br />
as (i) Juvenal (i) s</em>aid of the (i) Greeks. (i)<br />

<br />
By this means he holds Intelligence with their<br />
own Cons</em>ciences agains<em>t thems</em>elves, and keeps<br />
their very Thoughts in Slavery ; for Men com-<br />
monly fear thos<em>e that know any Evil of them,<br />
and out of Shame give Way to them. He is<br />
very cautious in venturing to attack any Man<br />
by Way of Convers</em>ion, whos<em>e Weaknes</em>s he is<br />
not very well acquainted with ; and like the<br />

Fox, weighs his Goos<em>e, before he will venture<br />
to carry him over a River. He fights with the<br />
(i) Devil (i) at his own Weapons, and s</em>trives to get<br />
ground on him with Frauds and Lies--Thes<em>e<br />
he convers to pious Us</em>es. He makes his<br />
Prayers (the proper Bus<em>ines</em>s of the Mind) a<br />
Kind of Manufacture, and vents them by Tale,<br />
rather than Weight ; and, while he is bus<em>ied<br />
in numbering them, forgets their Sens</em>e and<br />
Meaning. He s<em>ets them up as Men do their<br />
Games at (i) Picquet, (i) for fear he s</em>hould be mis<em>-<br />
reckoned; but never minds whether he plays<br />
fair or not. He s</em>ells Indulgences, like (i) Lockier's (i)<br />
Pills, with Directions how they are to be taken.<br />
He is but a Copyholder of the (i) Catholic (i) Church,<br />
that claims by Cus<em>tom. He believes the (i) Pope's (i)<br />
Chain is fas</em>tened to the Gates of Heaven, like<br />
King (i) Harry's (i) in the Privy-Gallery./</h1>
