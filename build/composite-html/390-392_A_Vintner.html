VINTNER</h1>
<p>H<sup>2</sup>ANGS out his Buſh to ſhew he has not<br />
good Wine ; for that, the Proverb ſays, needs it not. If wine were as neceſſary as<br />
Bread, he would ſtand in the Pillory for ſelling<br />
falſe Meaſure, as well as Bakers do for falſe<br />
Weight ; but ſince it is at every Man’s Choice<br />
to come to his Houſe or not, thoſe that do, are<br />
guilty of half the Injuries he does them, and<br />
he believes the reſt to be none at all, becauſe<br />
no Injury can be done to him, that is willing<br />
to take it. He had rather ſell bad Wine, than<br />
good that ſtands him in no more, for it makes<br />
Men ſooner drunk, and then they are the eaſier<br />
over-reckoned. By the Knaveries he acts<br />
above-board, which every Man ſees, one may<br />
eaſily take a Meaſure of thoſe he does under<br />
Ground in his Cellar ; for he that will pick<br />
a Man’s Pocket to his Face, will not ſtick to<br />
uſe him worſe in private when he knows no-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>thing of it. When he has poiſoned his<br />
Wines he raiſes his Price, and to make amends<br />
for that abates his Meaſure, for he thinks it<br />
a greater Sin to commit Murder for ſmall<br />
Gains, than a valuable Conſideration. He<br />
does not only ſpoil and deſtroy his Wines, but<br />
an ancient reverend Proverb, with brewing and<br />
racking, that ſays, <em>In vino veritas</em>, for there<br />
is no Truth in his, but all falſe and ſophiſtica-<br />
ted ; for he can counterfeit Wine as cunningly<br />
as <em>Apelles</em> did Grapes, and cheat Men with it,<br />
as <em>he</em> did Birds. He brings every Bottle of<br />
Wine he draws to the <em>Bar</em>, to confeſs it to be<br />
a Cheat, and afterwards puts himſelf upon<br />
the Mercy of the Company. He is an <em>Anti-</em><br />
<em>chriſtian</em> Cheat ; for Chriſt turned Water into<br />
Wine, and he turns Wine into Water. He<br />
ſcores all his Reckonings upon two Tables<br />
made like thoſe of the ten Commandments, that<br />
he may be put in Mind to break them as oft as<br />
poſſibly he can ; eſpecially that of ſtealing and<br />
bearing falſe Witneſs againſt his Neighbour,<br />
when he draws him bad Wine and ſwears it is<br />
good, and that he can take more for the Pipe<br />
than the Wine will yield him by the Bottle,<br />
a Trick that a <em>Jesuit</em> taught him to cheat his<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>own Conſcience with. When he is found to<br />
over-reckon notoriouſly, he has one common<br />
Evaſion for all, and that is to ſay it was a<br />
Miſtake, by which he means, that he thought<br />
they had not been ſober enough to diſcover it ;<br />
for if it had paſt, there had been no Error at<br />
all in the Caſe.<br />
