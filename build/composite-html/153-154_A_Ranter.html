<h1 id="a-ranter-1">A RANTER</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>s a <em>Fanatic</em> Hector, that has found out by a very ſtrange Way of new Light, how to transform all the <em>Devils</em> into <em>Angels of Light</em> ; for he believes all Religion conſiſts in Looſeneſs, and that Sin and Vice is <em>the whole Duty of Man</em>. He puts off the <em>old Man</em>, but puts it on again upon the <em>new one,</em> and makes his <em>Pagan</em> Vices ſerve to preſerve his <em>Chriſtian</em> Virtues from wearing out ; for if he ſhould uſe his Piety and Devotion al- ways it would hold out but a little while. He is loth that Iniquity and Vice ſhould be thrown away, as long as there may be good Uſe of it ; for if that, which is wickedly gotten, may be diſposed to pious Uſes, why ſhould not Wickedneſs itſelf as well? He believes himſelf Shot-free againſt all the Attempts of the <em>Devil,</em> the <em>World,</em> and the <em>Flesh,</em> and therefore is not afraid to attack them in their own Quarters, and encounter them at their own Weapons.</p>
<hr />
<p>For as ſtrong Bodies may freely venture to do,<br />
and ſuffer that, without any Hurt to them-<br />
ſelves, which would deſtroy thoſe that are<br />
feeble: So a Saint, that is ſtrong in Grace,<br />
may boldly engage himſelf in thoſe great Sins<br />
and Iniquities, that would eaſily damn a weak<br />
Brother, and yet come off never the worſe.<br />
He believes Deeds of Darkneſs to be only thoſe<br />
Sins that are committed in private, not thoſe<br />
that are acted openly and owned. He is but<br />
an <em>Hypocrite</em> turned the wrong Side outward ;<br />
for, as the one wears his Vices within, and<br />
the other without, ſo when they are counter-<br />
changed the <em>Ranter</em> becomes an <em>Hypocrite,</em> and<br />
the <em>Hypocrite</em> an able <em>Ranter.</em> His Church is<br />
the <em>Devil's</em> Chappel ; for it agrees exactly both<br />
in Doctorine and Diſicipline with the beſt reform-<br />
ed Baudy-Houſes. He is a Monſter produced<br />
by the Madneſs of this latter Age ; but if it<br />
had been his Fate to have been whelped in old<br />
<em>Rome</em> he had paſt for a Prodigy, and been re-<br />
ceived among raining of Stones and the ſpeak-<br />
ing of Bulls, and would have put a ſtop to all<br />
public Affairs, until he had been expiated.<br />
<em>Nero</em> cloathed <em>Chriſtians</em> in the Skins of wild<br />
Beaſts ; but he wraps wild Beaſts in the Skins<br />
of <em>Chriſtians</em>.<br />
