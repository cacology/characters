Imagination, to make that rugged and uneas<em>y,<br />
that was plain and open before. His Brain is<br />
s</em>o cracked, that he fancies hims<em>elf to be Glas</em>s,<br />
and is afraid that every Thing he comes near<br />
s<em>hould break him in Pieces. Whats</em>oever makes<br />
an Impres<em>s</em>ion in his Imagination works it s<em>elf<br />
in like a Screw, and the more he turns and<br />
winds it, the deeper it s</em>ticks, till it is never to<br />
be got out again. The Temper of his Brain<br />
being earthy, cold, and dry, is apt to breed<br />
Worms, that s<em>ink s</em>o deep into it, no Medicine<br />
in Art or Nature is able to reach them. He<br />
leads his Life, as one leads a Dog in a Slip<br />
that will not follow, but is dragged along until<br />
he is almos<em>t hanged, as he has it often under<br />
Cons</em>ideration to treat hims<em>elf in convenient<br />
Time and Place, if he can but catch hims</em>elf<br />
alone. After a long and mortal Feud between<br />
his inward and his outward Man, they at<br />
length agree to meet without Seconds, and decide the<br />
Quarrel, in which the one drops, and the<br />
other s<em>inks out fo the Way, and makes his<br />
Es</em>cape into s<em>ome foreign World, from whence<br />
is it never after heard of. He convers</em>es with<br />
nothing s<em>o much as his own Imagination,<br />
which being apt to mis</em>repres*ent Things to him,<br />

makes him believe, that it is s<em>omething els</em>e<br />
than it is, and that he holds Intelligence with<br />
Spirits, that reveal whats<em>oever he fancies to<br />
him, as the antient rude People, that firs</em>t heard<br />
their own Voices repeated by Echoes in the<br />
Woods, concluded it mus<em>t proceed from s</em>ome<br />
invisible Inhabitants of thos<em>e s</em>olitary Places,<br />
which they after believed to be Gods, and<br />
called them [i] Sylvans, Fauns, [i] and [i] Dryads. [i] He<br />
makes the Infirmity of his Temper pas<em>s for<br />
Revelations, as [i] Mahomet [i] did by his falling<br />
Sicknes</em>s, and ins<em>pires hims</em>elf with the Wind<br />
of his own Hypocondries. He laments, like<br />
[i] Heraclitus [i] the Maudlin Philos<em>opher, at other<br />
Men's Mirth, and take Pleas</em>ures in nothing<br />
but his own un-s<em>ober Sadnes</em>s. His Mind is<br />
full of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like<br />
a Nes<em>t of Boxes. He s</em>leeps little, but dreams<br />
much, and s<em>oundes</em>t when he is waking. He<br />
s<em>ees Vis</em>ions further off than a s<em>econd-s</em>ighted<br />
Man in [i] Scotland, [i] and dreams upon a hard<br />
Point with admirable Judgement. He is jus<em>t<br />
s</em>o much wors<em>e than a Madman, as he is below<br />
him in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen<br />
the mos</em>t mad govern all the res*t, and receive<br />
a natural Obedience from their Inferiors.<br />
