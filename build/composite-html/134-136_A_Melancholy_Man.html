<h1 id="a-melancholy-man-1">A<br />
MELANCHOLY MAN</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>s one, that keeps the worſt Company in the<br />
World, that is, his own; and tho' he be al-<br />
ways falling out and quarrelling with himſelf,<br />
yet he has not power to endure any other Con-<br />
verſation. His Head is haunted, like a Houſe,<br />
with evil Spirits and Apparitions, that terrify<br />
and fright him out of himſelf, till he ſtands<br />
empty and forſaken. His Sleeps and his Wa-<br />
kings are ſo much the ſame, that he knows not<br />
how to diſtinguiſh them, and many times<br />
when he dreams, he believes he is broad awake<br />
and ſees Viſions. The Fumes and Vapours<br />
that riſe from his Spleen and Hypocondries<br />
have ſo ſmutched and ſullied his Brain (like a<br />
Room that ſmoaks) that his Underſtanding is<br />
blear-ey'd, and has no right Perception of any<br />
Thing. His Soul lives in his Body, like a<br />
Mole in the Earth, that labours in the Dark,<br />
and caſts up Doubts and Scruples of his own</p>
<hr />
<p>Imagination, to make that rugged and uneaſy,<br />
that was plain and open before. His Brain is<br />
ſo cracked, that he fancies himſelf to be Glaſs,<br />
and is afraid that every Thing he comes near<br />
ſhould break him in Pieces. Whatſoever makes<br />
an Impreſſion in his Imagination works it ſelf<br />
in like a Screw, and the more he turns and<br />
winds it, the deeper it ſticks, till it is never to<br />
be got out again. The Temper of his Brain<br />
being earthy, cold, and dry, is apt to breed<br />
Worms, that ſink ſo deep into it, no Medicine<br />
in Art or Nature is able to reach them. He<br />
leads his Life, as one leads a Dog in a Slip<br />
that will not follow, but is dragged along until<br />
he is almoſt hanged, as he has it often under<br />
Conſideration to treat himſelf in convenient<br />
Time and Place, if he can but catch himſelf<br />
alone. After a long and mortal Feud between<br />
his inward and his outward Man, they at<br />
length agree to meet without Seconds, and decide the<br />
Quarrel, in which the one drops, and the<br />
other ſinks out fo the Way, and makes his<br />
Eſcape into ſome foreign World, from whence<br />
is it never after heard of. He converſes with<br />
nothing ſo much as his own Imagination,<br />
which being apt to miſrepreſent Things to him,</p>
<hr />
<p>makes him believe, that it is ſomething elſe<br />
than it is, and that he holds Intelligence with<br />
Spirits, that reveal whatſoever he fancies to<br />
him, as the antient rude People, that firſt heard<br />
their own Voices repeated by Echoes in the<br />
Woods, concluded it muſt proceed from ſome<br />
invisible Inhabitants of thoſe ſolitary Places,<br />
which they after believed to be Gods, and<br />
called them <em>Sylvans, Fauns,</em> and <em>Dryads.</em> He<br />
makes the Infirmity of his Temper paſs for<br />
Revelations, as <em>Mahomet</em> did by his falling<br />
Sickneſs, and inſpires himſelf with the Wind<br />
of his own Hypocondries. He laments, like<br />
<em>Heraclitus</em> the Maudlin Philoſopher, at other<br />
Men's Mirth, and take Pleaſures in nothing<br />
but his own un-ſober Sadneſs. His Mind is<br />
full of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like<br />
a Neſt of Boxes. He ſleeps little, but dreams<br />
much, and ſoundeſt when he is waking. He<br />
ſees Viſions further off than a ſecond-ſighted<br />
Man in <em>Scotland,</em> and dreams upon a hard<br />
Point with admirable Judgement. He is juſt<br />
ſo much worſe than a Madman, as he is below<br />
him in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen<br />
the moſt mad govern all the reſt, and receive<br />
a natural Obedience from their Inferiors.</p>
