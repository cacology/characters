<h1 id="an-astrologer-1">AN<br />
Astrologer</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">s</span> one that expounds upon the Planets, and<br />
teaches to conſtrue the <em>Accidents</em> by the <em>due<br />
joining of Stars in Conſtruction.</em> He talks with<br />
them by dumb Signs, and can tell what they<br />
mean by their twinckling, and ſquinting upon<br />
one another, as well as they themſelves. He<br />
is a Spy upon the Stars, and can tell what they<br />
are doing, by the Company they keep, and the<br />
Houſes they frequent. They have no Power to<br />
do any Thing alone, until ſo many meet, as<br />
will make a <em>Quorum.</em>He is Clerk of the Com-<br />
mittee to them, and draws up all their Orders,<br />
that concern either public or private Affairs.<br />
He keeps all their Accompts for them, and<br />
ſums them up, not by <em>Debtor,</em> but by <em>Creditor</em><br />
alone, a more compendious Way. They do<br />
ill to make them have ſo much Authority over<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>the Earth, which, perhaps, has as much as<br />
any one of them but the Sun, and as much<br />
Right to ſit and vote in their Councils, as any<br />
other : But becauſe there are but ſeven Electors<br />
of the <em>German</em> Empire, they will allow of no<br />
more to diſpoſe of all other ; and moſt fooliſhly<br />
and unnaturally depoſe their own Parent of its<br />
Inheritance; rather than acknowledge a Defect<br />
in their own Rules. Theſe Rules are all they<br />
have to ſhew for their Title ; and yet not one<br />
of them can tell whether thoſe they had them<br />
from came honeſtly by them. <em>Virgil's</em> Deſ-<br />
cription of <em>Fame,</em> that reaches from Earth<br />
to the Stars, <em>tam ficti pravique tenax,</em> to carry<br />
Lies and Knavery, will ſerve Aſtrologers with-<br />
out any ſenſible Variation. He is a Fortune-<br />
Seller, a Retailer of Deſtiny, and petty Chap-<br />
man to the Planets. He caſts Nativities as<br />
Gameſters do falſe Dice, and by ſlurring and<br />
palming <em>ſextile, quartile,</em> and <em>trine,</em> like <em>ſize,</em><br />
<em>quater, trois,</em> can throw what chance he<br />
pleaſes. He ſets a Figure, as Cheats do a Main<br />
at Hazard ; and Gulls throw away their Money<br />
at it. He fetches the Grounds of his Art ſo<br />
far off, as well from Reaſon, as the Stars, that,<br />
like a Traveller, he is allowed to lye by Au-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>thority. And as Beggars, that have no Money<br />
themſelves, believe all others have, and beg<br />
of thoſe, that have as little as themſelves : So<br />
the ignorant Rabble believe in him, though<br />
he has no more Reaſon for what he profeſſes,<br />
than they.<br />
