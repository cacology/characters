FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S one, that is not contented to be a Privy-<br />
Counſellor of the Kingdom of Heaven, but<br />
would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,<br />
and tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the<br />
Kingdom of Earth. His Deſign is to make<br />
<em>Chriſt</em> King, as his Forefathers the <em>Jew</em> did,<br />
only to abuſe and crucify him, that he might<br />
ſhare his Lands and Goods, as he did his Vice-<br />
gerents here. He dreams of a Fool's Paradiſe<br />
without a Serpent in it, a golden Age all of<br />
Saints, and no Hypocrites, all <em>holy-Court</em> Princes,<br />
and no Subjects but the Wicked ; a Govern-<br />
ment of <em>Perkin Warbec</em> and <em>Lambert Simnel</em><br />
Saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it,<br />
might make himſelf a Price, and claim a<br />
Title to the Crown. He fancies a <em>fifth-Mo-</em><br />
<em>narchy</em> as the Quinteſſence of all Governments,<br />
abſtracted from all Matter, and conſiſting<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and Myſteries.<br />
<em>John</em> of <em>Leyden</em> was the firſt Founder of it, and<br />
though he miſcarried, like <em>Romulus</em> in a Tem-<br />
peſt, his Poſterity have Revelations every full<br />
Moon, that there may be a Time to ſet up his<br />
Title again, and with better Succeſs ; though<br />
his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had<br />
no ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,<br />
but their whole outward Men were ſet on the<br />
Gates of the City ; where a Head and four<br />
Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of the<br />
<em>fifth-Monarchy.</em> They have been contriving (ſince<br />
Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-<br />
ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed King<br />
<em>Oberon,</em> to erect their Monarchy in <em>Fairy-Land,</em><br />
as being the moſt proper and natural Region in<br />
the whole World for their Government, and if<br />
it ſucceed there to proceed further. The <em>De-</em><br />
<em>vil's</em> Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,<br />
and the Glory of them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,<br />
that they would venture their Necks to take<br />
him at his Word, and give him his Price.<br />
Nothing comes ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-<br />
neſs as the <em>fifth-Monarchy,</em> that is no where to<br />
be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-<br />
thologies, and myſtical Riddles, like the Vi-<br />
ſions <em>Aeneas</em> ſaw in Hell of the <em>Roman</em> Empire.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Next this it moſt reſembles <em>Mahomet</em>’s Coming<br />
to the <em>Turks,</em> and King <em>Arthur</em>’s Reign over the<br />
Britons in <em>Merlin</em>’s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin<br />
are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern<br />
the ſame Lineaments in them all. The poor<br />
Wicked are like to have a very ill time under<br />
them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-<br />
vernment, according to their ancient and fun-<br />
damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects<br />
but Slaves, who between them and the <em>Devil</em><br />
are like to ſuffer Perſecution enough to make<br />
them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-<br />
ters. He gathers Churches on the Sunday, as<br />
the <em>Jews</em> did Sticks on their Sabbath, to ſet the<br />
State on Fire. He humms and hahs high Trea-<br />
ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the<br />
Caſt they would throw. He groans Sedition,<br />
and, like the <em>Phariſee,</em> rails, when he gives<br />
Thanks. He interprets Propheſies, as <em>Whitting-<br />
ton</em> did the Bells, to ſpeak to him, and governs<br />
himſelf accordingly.<br />
