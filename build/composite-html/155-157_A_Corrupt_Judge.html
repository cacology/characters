<h1 id="a-corrupt-judge-1">A<br />
CORRUPT JUDGE</h1>
<p>P<sup>2</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">asses</span> Judgement as a Gameſter does<br />
falſe Dice. The firſt Thing he takes is<br />
his Oath and his Comiſſion, and afterwards<br />
the ſtrongeſt Side and Bribes. He gives Judg-<br />
ment, as the Council at the Bar are ſaid to give<br />
Advice, when they are paid for it. He wraps<br />
himſelf warm in Furs, that the cold Air may<br />
not ſtrike his Conſcience inward. He is never<br />
an upright Judge, but when he is weary of<br />
ſitting, and ſtands for his Eaſe. All the Uſe<br />
he make of his Oath is to oppoſe it againſt<br />
his Prince, for whoſe Service he firſt took it,<br />
and to bind him with that, which he firſt pre-<br />
tended to bind himſelf with; as if the King by<br />
imparting a little of his Power to him gave<br />
hi to Title to all the reſt, like thoſe who hold-<br />
ing a little Land in <em>Capite</em> render all the reſt<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>liable to the ſame Tenure. As for that which<br />
concerns the People, he takes his Liberty to do<br />
what he pleaſes ; this he maintains with Cant-<br />
ing, of which himſelf being the only Judge,<br />
he can give it what arbitrary Interpretation he<br />
pleaſes ; yet is a great Enemy to arbitrary<br />
Power, becauſe he would have no Body uſe it<br />
but himſelf. If he have Hope of Preferment<br />
he makes all the Law run on the King's Side ;<br />
if not, it always takes part againſt him ; for as<br />
he was bred to make any Thing right or wrong<br />
between Man and Man, ſo he can do between<br />
the King and his Subjects. He calls himſelf<br />
<em>Capitalis, &amp;c.</em> which Word he never uſes but<br />
to Crimes of the higeſt Nature. He uſurps<br />
unſufferable Tyranny over Words ; for when<br />
he has enſlaved and debaſed them from their<br />
original Senſe, he makes them ſerves againſt<br />
themselves to ſupport him, and their own<br />
Abuſe. He is as ſtiff to Delinquents, and<br />
makes as harſh a Noiſe as a new Cart-wheel,<br />
until he is greaſed, and then he turns about as<br />
eaſily. He called all necceſſary and unavoidable<br />
Proceedings of State, without the punctual<br />
Formality of Law, arbitrary and illegal, but<br />
never conſiders, that his own Interpretation<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>of Law are more arbitrary, and, when he<br />
pleaſes, illegal. He cannot be denied to be a<br />
very impartial Judge ; for right or wrong<br />
are all one to him. He takes Bribes, as pious<br />
Men give Alms, with ſo much Caution, that<br />
his right Hand never knows what his left re-<br />
ceives./</p>
