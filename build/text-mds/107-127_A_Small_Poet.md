#A\
SMALL POET

I^2^S one, that would fain make himſelf that,\
which *Nature* never meant him ; like a *Fa-*\
*natic*, that inſpires himſelf with his own\
Whimſies.  He ſets up Haberdaſher of ſmall\
Poetry, with a very ſmall Stock, and no Credit.\
He believes it is Invention enough to find out\
other Men’s Wit ; and whatſoever he lights upon\
either in Books, or Company, he makes bold\
with as his own.  This he puts together ſo un-\
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit\
has the Rickets, by the ſwelling Diſproportion\
of the Joints.  Imitation is the whole Sum of\
him ; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that\
he has catched of others ; and his Flame like\
that of Charcoals, that were burnt before :\
But as he wants Judgment to underſtand what\
is beſt, he naturally takes the worſt, as being\
moſt agreeable to his own Talent.  You may\


---


know his Wit not to be natural, ’tis ſo un-\
quiet and troubleſome in him : For as thoſe,\
that have Money but ſeldom, are always ſhak-\
ing their Pockets, when they have it ; ſo does\
he, when he thinks he has got ſomething, that\
will make him appear.  He is a perpetual Tal-\
ker ; and you may know by the Freedom of his\
Diſcourſe, that he came light by it, as Thieves\
ſpend freely what they get.  He meaſures other\
Men’s Wits by *their* Modeſty, and his own by\
*his* Confidence.  He makes nothing of writing\
Plays, becauſe he has not Wit enough to un-\
derstand the Difficulty.  This makes him ven-\
ture to talk and ſcribble, as Chowſes do to play\
with cunning Gameſters, until they are cheated\
and laughed at.  He is always talking of Wit,\
as thoſe, that have bad Voices, are always ſing-\
ing out of Tune ; and thoſe, that cannot play,\
delight to fumble on Inſtruments.  He grows\
the unwiſer by other Men’s Harms ; for the\
worſe others write, he finds the more Encou-\
ragement to do ſo too.  His Greedineſs of\
Praiſe is ſo eager, that he ſwallows any Thing,\
that comes in the Likeneſs of it, how notorious\
and palpable ſoever, and is as Shot-free againſt\
any Thing, that may leſſen his good Opinion\


---


of himſelf---This renders him incurable, like\
Diſeaſes, that grow inſenſible.

   If you diſlike him it is at your own Peril ;\
he is ſure to put in a Caveat beforehand againſt\
your Understanding ; and, like a Malefactor\
in Wit, is always furniſhed with Exceptions\
againſt his Judges.  This puts him upon perpe-\
tual Apologies, Excuſes, and Defences, but\
ſtill by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-\
fling Strain, without Regard of any Man,\
that ſtands in the Way of his Pageant.\
Where he thinks he may do it ſafely, he\
will confidently own other Men’s Writings ;\
and where he fears the Truth may be diſcovered,\
he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inſinua-\
tions give Men Occaſion to ſuppoſe ſo.

   If he underſtands *Latin* or *Greek* he ranks\
himſelf among the Learned, deſpiſes the Igno-\
rant, talks Criticiſms out of *Scaliger*, and re-\
peats *Martial*'s baudy Epigrams, and ſets up\
his Reſt wholly upon Pedantry.  But if he be\
not ſo well qualified, he crys down all Learning\
as pedantic, diſclaims Study, and profeſſes to\
write with as great Facility, as if his Muſe was\


---


ſliding down *Parnaſſus*.  Whatſoever he hears\
well ſaid[^1] he ſeizes upon by poetical Licence ;\
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill\
repeating of it---This he believes to be no\
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others\
throw away.  By this means his Writings are,\
like a Taylor’s Cuſhion, of moſaic Work,\
made up of ſeveral Scraps ſewed together.\
He calls a ſlovenly naſty Deſcription *great Na-*\
*ture*, and dull Flatneſs *strange Eaſineſs*.  He\
writes down all that comes in his Head, and\
makes no Choice, becauſe he has nothing to\
do it with, that is Judgment.  He is always\
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like\
the *long Parliament* making *Ordinances* in their\
Stead ; although they are perpetually *thrown*\
*out* of Coffee-Houſes, and come to Nothing.\
He is like an *Italian* Thief, that never robs,\
but he murthers, to prevent Diſcovery ; ſo ſure\
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-\
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may paſs\
unſuſpected.  He is but a Copier at beſt, and\
will never arrive to practice by the Life : For\
bar him the Imitation of ſomething he has\
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.

[^1]: *Whatſoever he hears well ſaid*, &tc. ] In this *Butler* alludes to\
*Martial*'s Epigram to *Fidentinus*. [*footnote cont. next page*][^2]


---


Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form\
of juſt Wit, are above his Philoſophy.  He\
appears ſo over concerned in all Men’s Wits,\
as if they were but Diſparagements of his\
own ; and crys down all they do, as if they\
were Encroachments upon him.  He takes\
Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them, as\
*Justices* do falſe Weights, and Pots that want\
Meaſure.  When he meets with any Thing,\
that is very good, he changes it into ſmall\
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to\
ſerve ſeveral Occaſions.  He diſclaims Study,\
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to ſhoot\
flying, which appears to be very true by his\
often miſſing of his Mark.  His Wit is much\
troubled with Obſtructions ;  and he has Fits as\
painful as thoſe of the Spleen.   He fancies him-\
ſelf a dainty ſpruce Shepherd, with a Flock and\
a fine ſilken Shepherdeſs, that follows his Pipe,\
as Rats did the Conjurers in *Germany*.

   As for *Epithets*, he always avoids thoſe, that\
are near akin to the Senſse.  Such matches are\
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a *Chriſtian*\
Poet ; and therefore all his Care is to chuſe out\

ſuch, as will ſerve, like a wooden Leg, to piece\
out a main’d Verſe, that wants a Foot or two ;\
and if they will but rhimes now and then into\
the Bargain, or run upon a Letter, it is a Work\
of Supererrogation.

   For *Similitudes*, he likes the hardeſt and moſt\
obſcure beſt : For as Ladies wear black Patches,\
to make their Complexions ſeem fairer than\
they are ; ſo when an Illuſtration is more ob-\
ſcure than the Senſe that went before it, it muſt\
of Neceſſity make it appear clearer than it\
did : For Contraries are beſt ſet off with Con-\
traries.

   He has found out a Way to ſave the Expence\
of much Wit and Senſe : For he will make\
leſs than ſome have prodigally laid out upon\
five or ſix Words ſerve forty or fifty Lines.\
This is a thrifty Invention, and very eaſy ; and,\
if it were commonly known, would much in-\
creaſe the Trade of Wit, and maintain a Mul-

in the Life of *Virgil* aſcribed to *Donatus*. “ Cum Georgica ſcribe-\

“ non abſurde carmen ſe urſæ more parere dicens, et lambendo\

titude of ſmall Poets in conſtant Employment.\
He has found out a new Sort of poetical *Geor-*\
*gics*, a Trick of ſowing Wit like clover-graſs\
on barren Subjects, which would yield nothing\
before.  This is very uſeful for the Times,\
wherein, ſome Men ſay, there is no Room left\
for new Invention.  He will take three Grains\
of Wit like the Elixir, and projecting it upon\
the *Iron-Age* turn it immediately into *Gold---*\
All the Buſineſs of Mankind has preſently\
vaniſhed, the whole World has kept Holiday ;\
there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,\
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdeſſes ;\
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed\
Plum-Porrige.

   We read that *Virgil* uſed to make[^3] fifty or\
ſixty Verſes in a Morning, and afterwards re-\
duce them to ten.  This was an unthrifty\
Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the\
Huſbandry of his own Poetry, as *Seneca* ſays\
he was in that of a Farm ;[^4] for in plain *Engliſh*

[^4]: *As* Seneca *ſays he was in that of a farm*.] *Seneca* in his 86th\
Epiſtle finds ſeveral Faults with *Virgil*'s Rules and Obſervations in\
Huſbandry, as they are delivered in his *Georgics*, and adds of him ---\
“ Qui non quod veriſſime, ſed quid decentiſſime diceretur, ad-\
“ ſpexit ; nec Agricolas docere voluit, ſed legentes delectare.”


---


it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine-\
pence.  And as ſuch Courſes brought the\
*prodigal Son* to eat with Hogs : So they did him\
to feed with Horſes,[^5] which were not much\
better Company, and may teach us to avoid\
doing the like.  For certainly it is more noble\
to take four or five Grains of Senſe, and, like\
a Gold-Beater, hammer them into ſo many\
Leaves as will fill a whole Book ; than to write\
nothing but Epitomies, which many wiſe Men\
believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.

   When he writes, he commonly ſteers the\
Senſe of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the\
End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the\
Tail.  For when he has made one Line, which\
is eaſy enough ; and has found out ſome ſturdy\
hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham-\
mer the Senſe upon it, like a Piece of hot Iron\
upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleaſes.

   There is no Art in the World ſo rich in\
Terms as Poetry ; a whole Dictionary is ſcarce

[^5]: *So they did him to feed with Horſes*]  This muſt be explained by\
the ſame Writer of *Virgil*’s Life, who informs us, that *Virgil* in\
his Youth ſtudied Phyſic, in which having made great Proficiency,\
he repaired to *Rome*, and applying himſelf to that Branch of it [*footnote cont. next page*][^6]


---


able to contain them : For there is hardly a\
Pond, a Sheep-walk, or a Gravel-pit in all\
*Greece*, but the antient Name of it is become\
a Term of Art in Poetry.  By this means ſmall\
Poets have ſuch a Stock of able hard Words lying\
by them, as *Dryades*, *Hamadryades*, *Aonides*, *Fauni*,\
*Nymphae*, *Sylvani*, *&c*. that ſignify nothing at all ;\
and ſuch a World of pedantic Terms of the\
ſame Kind, as may ſerve to furniſh all the new\
Inventions and *thorough-Reformations*, that can\
happen between this and *Plato*’s great Year.

   When he writes he never propoſes any Scope\
or Purpoſe to himſelf, but gives his Genius all\
Freedom : For as he, that rides abroad for his\
Pleaſure, can hardly be out of his Way ; ſo he\
that writes for his Pleaſure, can ſeldom be be-\
ſide his Subject.  It is an ungrateful Thing to\
a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing---\
To what Purpoſe did the Antients feign *Pegaſus*\
to have Wings, if he muſt be confined to the\
Road and Stages like a Pack-Horſe, or be forced\
to be obedient to Hedges and Ditches?  There-

*gustus*'s Stables with great Succeſs, and by that Means introduced\
himſelf into the Favour of that Prince.


---


fore he has no Reſpect to Decorum and Pro-\
priety of Circumſtance ; for the Regard of\
Perſons, Times, and Places is a Reſtraint too\
ſervile to be impoſed upon poetical Licence ;\
like him that made *Plato*[^7] confeſs *Juvenal* to be\
a Philoſopher, or *Perſius*, that calls the *Athe*-\
*nians Quirites*.

   For *Metaphors*, he uſes to chuſe the hardeſt,\
and moſt far-fet that he can light upon---Theſe\
are the Jewels of Eloquence, and therefore the\
harder they are, the more precious they muſt\
be.

   He’ll take ſcant Piece of coarſe Senſe, and\
ſtretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a ſcore\
Rhimes, until it crack that you may ſee through\
it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head.  When\
you ſee his Verſes hanged up in Tobacco-Shops,\
you may ſay, in defiance of the Proverb, *that*\
*the weakeſt does not always go to the Wall* ; for ’tis

[^7]: *Like him that made Plato*, &c.] Who this Blunder is to be fa-\
thered upon I cannot diſcover ; but that which he imputes to *Per*-\
*ſius*, and another of *Juvenal*’s, a Paſſage of his own in a Part of his\
Proſe Collections called *Criticiſms upon Books and Autohrs*, will ex-\
plain --- *Persius*, ſays he, commits a very great Abſurdity, when\
laying the Scene of his fourth Satyr in *Greece*, and bringing in *So*-\
*crates* reproving a young Stateſmen, he makes him call the *Græ*-\
*cians* Quirites. [*footnote cont. next page*][^8]


---


well known the Lines are ſtrong enough, and\
in that Senſe may juſtly take the Wall of any,\
that have been written in our Language.  He\
ſeldom makes a Conſcience of his Rhimes ; but\
will often take the Liberty to make *preach*\
rhime with *Cheat*, *Vote* with *Rogue*, and *Com*-\
*mittee-Man* with *Hang*.

   He’ll make one Word of as many Joints, as\
the Tin-Pudding, that a Jugler pulls out of\
his Throat, and chops in again---What think\
you of *glud-fum-flam-hasta-minantes ?*  Some of\
the old *Latin* Poets[^9] bragged, that their Verſes\
were tougher than Braſs, and harder than\
Marble ; what would they have done, if they\
had ſeen theſe ? Verily they would have had\
more reaſon to wiſh themſelves an hundred\
Throats, than they then had, to pronounce them.

   There are ſome, that drive a Trade in writ-\
ing in praiſe of other Writers, (like Rooks,

   A SMALL POET.  127/
in the whole World have been glad to derive/
their Pedigrees, and their Power too, from/
Poets.  [i] Alexander [i] the great had no wis*er a Way/
so s*ecure the Empire to hims*elf by [i] Right, [i]/
which he had gotten by [i] Force, [i] then by de-/
claring hims*elf the Son of [i] Jupiter; [i] and who/
was [i] Jupiter [i] but the Son of a Poet? So [i] Caes*ar [i]/
and all [i] Rome [i] was transported with Joy, when a/
Poet made [i] Jupiter [i] his Colleague in the Empire;/
and when [i] Jupiter [i] governed, what did the/
Poets, that governed Jupiter?/
