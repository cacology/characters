and s</em>crupulous of his Humour, as [i] Fantatics [i]<br />
are of their Cons<em>ciences, and both for the mos</em>t<br />
part in Trifles. He cares not how unus<em>eful<br />
any Thing be, s</em>o it be but unus<em>ual and rare.<br />
He collects all the Curious</em>ities he can light upon<br />
in Art or Nature, not to inform his own<br />
Judgement, but to catch the Admiration of o-<br />
thers, which he believes he has a Right to, be-<br />
caus<em>e the Rarities are his own. That which<br />
other Men neglect he believes they overs</em>ee,<br />
and s<em>tores up Trifles as rare Dis</em>coveries, at leas<em>t<br />
of his own Wit and Sagacity. He admires<br />
subtleties above all Things, becaus</em>e the more<br />
s<em>ubtle they are, the nearer they are to nothing;<br />
and values no Art but that which is s</em>pun s*o<br />
