<h1 id="a-quibbler">A<br />
QUIBBLER</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>s a Jugler of Words, that ſhows Tricks<br />
with them, to make them appear what they<br />
were not meant for, and ſerve two Senſes at<br />
once, like one that plays on two <em>Jews</em> Trumps.<br />
He is a Fencer of Language, that falſiſies his<br />
Blow, and hits where he did not aim. He<br />
Has a fooliſh Slight of Wit, that catches at<br />
Words only, and lets the Senſe go, like the<br />
young Thief in the Farce, that took a Purſe,<br />
but gave the Owner his Money back again.<br />
He is ſo well verſed in all Cafes of Quibble,<br />
that he knows when there will be a Blot upon<br />
a Word, as ſoon as it is out. He packs his<br />
Quibbles like a Stock of Cards, let him but<br />
ſhuffle, and cut where you will, he will be<br />
ſure to have it. He dances on a Rope of Sand,<br />
does the <em>Somerſet</em>, <em>Strapado</em>, and half-ſlrapado<br />
with Words, plays at all manner of Games<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>with <em>Clinches</em>, <em>Carwickets</em>, and <em>Quibbles</em>, and<br />
talks <em>under-Leg</em>. His Wit is left-handed, and<br />
therefore what others mean for right, he ap-<br />
prehends quite contrary. All his Conceptions<br />
are produced by equivocal Generation, which<br />
makes them juſtly eſteemed but Maggots. He<br />
rings the Changes upon Words, and is ſo ex-<br />
pert, that he can tell at firſt Sight, how<br />
many Variations any Number of Words will<br />
bear. He talks with a <em>Trillo</em>, and gives his<br />
Words a double Reliſh. He had rather have<br />
them bear two Senſes in vain and impertinent-<br />
ly, than one to the Purpoſe, and never ſpeaks<br />
without a Lere-Senſe. He talks nothing but<br />
Equivocation and mental Reſervation, and<br />
mightily affects to give a Word a double Stroke,<br />
like a Tennis-Ball againſt two Walls at one<br />
Blow, to defeat the Expectation of his An-<br />
tagonift. He commonly ſlurs every fourth or<br />
fifth Word, and ſeldom fails to throw Dou-<br />
blets. There are two Sorts of Quibbling, the<br />
one with Words, and the other with Senſe,<br />
like the Rhetoricians <em>Figurae Dictionis &amp; Figurae</em><br />
<em>Senteniae</em> — The firſt is already cried down,<br />
[^1]: <em>Without a Lere-Serſe] A Lere-Sterſe</em> is a ſecond or supernume-<br />
rary Scale, as a Led-Horſe was formerly called a Lere-Harſe,<br />
See <em>Bailey’s</em> Dictionary.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>and the other as yet prevails; and is the only<br />
Elegance of our modern Poets, which eaſy<br />
Judges call <em>Eaſineſs</em>; but having nothing in it<br />
But <em>Eaſineſs</em>, and being never uſed by any laſt-<br />
ing Wit, will in wiſer Times fall to nothing of<br />
itſselſ.<br />
