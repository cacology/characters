<h1 id="a-small-poet">A<br />
SMALL POET</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S one, that would fain make himſelf that,<br />
which <em>Nature</em> never meant him ; like a <em>Fa-</em><br />
<em>natic</em>, that inſpires himſelf with his own<br />
Whimſies. He ſets up Haberdaſher of ſmall<br />
Poetry, with a very ſmall Stock, and no Credit.<br />
He believes it is Invention enough to find out<br />
other Men’s Wit ; and whatſoever he lights upon<br />
either in Books, or Company, he makes bold<br />
with as his own. This he puts together ſo un-<br />
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit<br />
has the Rickets, by the ſwelling Diſproportion<br />
of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of<br />
him ; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that<br />
he has catched of others ; and his Flame like<br />
that of Charcoals, that were burnt before :<br />
But as he wants Judgment to underſtand what<br />
is beſt, he naturally takes the worſt, as being<br />
moſt agreeable to his own Talent. You may<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>know his Wit not to be natural, ’tis ſo un-<br />
quiet and troubleſome in him : For as thoſe,<br />
that have Money but ſeldom, are always ſhak-<br />
ing their Pockets, when they have it ; ſo does<br />
he, when he thinks he has got ſomething, that<br />
will make him appear. He is a perpetual Tal-<br />
ker ; and you may know by the Freedom of his<br />
Diſcourſe, that he came light by it, as Thieves<br />
ſpend freely what they get. He meaſures other<br />
Men’s Wits by <em>their</em> Modeſty, and his own by<br />
<em>his</em> Confidence. He makes nothing of writing<br />
Plays, becauſe he has not Wit enough to un-<br />
derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-<br />
ture to talk and ſcribble, as Chowſes do to play<br />
with cunning Gameſters, until they are cheated<br />
and laughed at. He is always talking of Wit,<br />
as thoſe, that have bad Voices, are always ſing-<br />
ing out of Tune ; and thoſe, that cannot play,<br />
delight to fumble on Inſtruments. He grows<br />
the unwiſer by other Men’s Harms ; for the<br />
worſe others write, he finds the more Encou-<br />
ragement to do ſo too. His Greedineſs of<br />
Praiſe is ſo eager, that he ſwallows any Thing,<br />
that comes in the Likeneſs of it, how notorious<br />
and palpable ſoever, and is as Shot-free againſt<br />
any Thing, that may leſſen his good Opinion<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>of himſelf---This renders him incurable, like<br />
Diſeaſes, that grow inſenſible.</p>
<p>If you diſlike him it is at your own Peril ;<br />
he is ſure to put in a Caveat beforehand againſt<br />
your Understanding ; and, like a Malefactor<br />
in Wit, is always furniſhed with Exceptions<br />
againſt his Judges. This puts him upon perpe-<br />
tual Apologies, Excuſes, and Defences, but<br />
ſtill by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-<br />
fling Strain, without Regard of any Man,<br />
that ſtands in the Way of his Pageant.<br />
Where he thinks he may do it ſafely, he<br />
will confidently own other Men’s Writings ;<br />
and where he fears the Truth may be diſcovered,<br />
he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inſinua-<br />
tions give Men Occaſion to ſuppoſe ſo.</p>
<p>If he underſtands <em>Latin</em> or <em>Greek</em> he ranks<br />
himſelf among the Learned, deſpiſes the Igno-<br />
rant, talks Criticiſms out of <em>Scaliger</em>, and re-<br />
peats <em>Martial</em>'s baudy Epigrams, and ſets up<br />
his Reſt wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be<br />
not ſo well qualified, he crys down all Learning<br />
as pedantic, diſclaims Study, and profeſſes to<br />
write with as great Facility, as if his Muſe was<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>ſliding down <em>Parnaſſus</em>. Whatſoever he hears<br />
well ſaid<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> he ſeizes upon by poetical Licence ;<br />
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill<br />
repeating of it---This he believes to be no<br />
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others<br />
throw away. By this means his Writings are,<br />
like a Taylor’s Cuſhion, of moſaic Work,<br />
made up of ſeveral Scraps ſewed together.<br />
He calls a ſlovenly naſty Deſcription <em>great Na-</em><br />
<em>ture</em>, and dull Flatneſs <em>strange Eaſineſs</em>. He<br />
writes down all that comes in his Head, and<br />
makes no Choice, becauſe he has nothing to<br />
do it with, that is Judgment. He is always<br />
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like<br />
the <em>long Parliament</em> making <em>Ordinances</em> in their<br />
Stead ; although they are perpetually <em>thrown</em><br />
<em>out</em> of Coffee-Houſes, and come to Nothing.<br />
He is like an <em>Italian</em> Thief, that never robs,<br />
but he murthers, to prevent Diſcovery ; ſo ſure<br />
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-<br />
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may paſs<br />
unſuſpected. He is but a Copier at beſt, and<br />
will never arrive to practice by the Life : For<br />
bar him the Imitation of ſomething he has<br />
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.</p>
<hr />
<p>Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form<br />
of juſt Wit, are above his Philoſophy. He<br />
appears ſo over concerned in all Men’s Wits,<br />
as if they were but Diſparagements of his<br />
own ; and crys down all they do, as if they<br />
were Encroachments upon him. He takes<br />
Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them, as<br />
<em>Justices</em> do falſe Weights, and Pots that want<br />
Meaſure. When he meets with any Thing,<br />
that is very good, he changes it into ſmall<br />
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to<br />
ſerve ſeveral Occaſions. He diſclaims Study,<br />
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to ſhoot<br />
flying, which appears to be very true by his<br />
often miſſing of his Mark. His Wit is much<br />
troubled with Obſtructions ; and he has Fits as<br />
painful as thoſe of the Spleen. He fancies him-<br />
ſelf a dainty ſpruce Shepherd, with a Flock and<br />
a fine ſilken Shepherdeſs, that follows his Pipe,<br />
as Rats did the Conjurers in <em>Germany</em>.</p>
<p>As for <em>Epithets</em>, he always avoids thoſe, that<br />
are near akin to the Senſse. Such matches are<br />
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a <em>Chriſtian</em><br />
Poet ; and therefore all his Care is to chuſe out<br />
[^2]: [<em>footnote cont'd from prev. page</em>] <em>Quem recitas meus eſt, O Fidentine, libellus :</em><br />
<em>Sed male dum recitas, incipit eſſe tuus.    Mart. L. 1. Ep. 39.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>ſuch, as will ſerve, like a wooden Leg, to piece<br />
out a main’d Verſe, that wants a Foot or two ;<br />
and if they will but rhimes now and then into<br />
the Bargain, or run upon a Letter, it is a Work<br />
of Supererrogation.</p>
<p>For <em>Similitudes</em>, he likes the hardeſt and moſt<br />
obſcure beſt : For as Ladies wear black Patches,<br />
to make their Complexions ſeem fairer than<br />
they are ; ſo when an Illuſtration is more ob-<br />
ſcure than the Senſe that went before it, it muſt<br />
of Neceſſity make it appear clearer than it<br />
did : For Contraries are beſt ſet off with Con-<br />
traries.</p>
<p>He has found out a Way to ſave the Expence<br />
of much Wit and Senſe : For he will make<br />
leſs than ſome have prodigally laid out upon<br />
five or ſix Words ſerve forty or fifty Lines.<br />
This is a thrifty Invention, and very eaſy ; and,<br />
if it were commonly known, would much in-<br />
creaſe the Trade of Wit, and maintain a Mul-</p>
<hr />
<p>titude of ſmall Poets in conſtant Employment.<br />
He has found out a new Sort of poetical <em>Geor-</em><br />
<em>gics</em>, a Trick of ſowing Wit like clover-graſs<br />
on barren Subjects, which would yield nothing<br />
before. This is very uſeful for the Times,<br />
wherein, ſome Men ſay, there is no Room left<br />
for new Invention. He will take three Grains<br />
of Wit like the Elixir, and projecting it upon<br />
the <em>Iron-Age</em> turn it immediately into <em>Gold---</em><br />
All the Buſineſs of Mankind has preſently<br />
vaniſhed, the whole World has kept Holiday ;<br />
there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,<br />
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdeſſes ;<br />
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed<br />
Plum-Porrige.</p>
<p>We read that <em>Virgil</em> uſed to make<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> fifty or<br />
ſixty Verſes in a Morning, and afterwards re-<br />
duce them to ten. This was an unthrifty<br />
Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the<br />
Huſbandry of his own Poetry, as <em>Seneca</em> ſays<br />
he was in that of a Farm ;<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> for in plain <em>Engliſh</em></p>
<hr />
<p>it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine-<br />
pence. And as ſuch Courſes brought the<br />
<em>prodigal Son</em> to eat with Hogs : So they did him<br />
to feed with Horſes,<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> which were not much<br />
better Company, and may teach us to avoid<br />
doing the like. For certainly it is more noble<br />
to take four or five Grains of Senſe, and, like<br />
a Gold-Beater, hammer them into ſo many<br />
Leaves as will fill a whole Book ; than to write<br />
nothing but Epitomies, which many wiſe Men<br />
believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.</p>
<p>When he writes, he commonly ſteers the<br />
Senſe of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the<br />
End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the<br />
Tail. For when he has made one Line, which<br />
is eaſy enough ; and has found out ſome ſturdy<br />
hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham-<br />
mer the Senſe upon it, like a Piece of hot Iron<br />
upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleaſes.</p>
<p>There is no Art in the World ſo rich in<br />
Terms as Poetry ; a whole Dictionary is ſcarce</p>
<hr />
<p>able to contain them : For there is hardly a<br />
Pond, a Sheep-walk, or a Gravel-pit in all<br />
<em>Greece</em>, but the antient Name of it is become<br />
a Term of Art in Poetry. By this means ſmall<br />
Poets have ſuch a Stock of able hard Words lying<br />
by them, as <em>Dryades</em>, <em>Hamadryades</em>, <em>Aonides</em>, <em>Fauni</em>,<br />
<em>Nymphae</em>, <em>Sylvani</em>, <em>&amp;c</em>. that ſignify nothing at all ;<br />
and ſuch a World of pedantic Terms of the<br />
ſame Kind, as may ſerve to furniſh all the new<br />
Inventions and <em>thorough-Reformations</em>, that can<br />
happen between this and <em>Plato</em>’s great Year.</p>
<p>When he writes he never propoſes any Scope<br />
or Purpoſe to himſelf, but gives his Genius all<br />
Freedom : For as he, that rides abroad for his<br />
Pleaſure, can hardly be out of his Way ; ſo he<br />
that writes for his Pleaſure, can ſeldom be be-<br />
ſide his Subject. It is an ungrateful Thing to<br />
a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing---<br />
To what Purpoſe did the Antients feign <em>Pegaſus</em><br />
to have Wings, if he muſt be confined to the<br />
Road and Stages like a Pack-Horſe, or be forced<br />
to be obedient to Hedges and Ditches? There-</p>
<hr />
<p>fore he has no Reſpect to Decorum and Pro-<br />
priety of Circumſtance ; for the Regard of<br />
Perſons, Times, and Places is a Reſtraint too<br />
ſervile to be impoſed upon poetical Licence ;<br />
like him that made <em>Plato</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> confeſs <em>Juvenal</em> to be<br />
a Philoſopher, or <em>Perſius</em>, that calls the <em>Athe</em>-<br />
<em>nians Quirites</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>Metaphors</em>, he uſes to chuſe the hardeſt,<br />
and moſt far-fet that he can light upon---Theſe<br />
are the Jewels of Eloquence, and therefore the<br />
harder they are, the more precious they muſt<br />
be.</p>
<p>He’ll take ſcant Piece of coarſe Senſe, and<br />
ſtretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a ſcore<br />
Rhimes, until it crack that you may ſee through<br />
it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head. When<br />
you ſee his Verſes hanged up in Tobacco-Shops,<br />
you may ſay, in defiance of the Proverb, <em>that</em><br />
<em>the weakeſt does not always go to the Wall</em> ; for ’tis</p>
<hr />
<p>well known the Lines are ſtrong enough, and<br />
in that Senſe may juſtly take the Wall of any,<br />
that have been written in our Language. He<br />
ſeldom makes a Conſcience of his Rhimes ; but<br />
will often take the Liberty to make <em>preach</em><br />
rhime with <em>Cheat</em>, <em>Vote</em> with <em>Rogue</em>, and <em>Com</em>-<br />
<em>mittee-Man</em> with <em>Hang</em>.</p>
<p>He’ll make one Word of as many Joints, as<br />
the Tin-Pudding, that a Jugler pulls out of<br />
his Throat, and chops in again---What think<br />
you of <em>glud-fum-flam-hasta-minantes ?</em> Some of<br />
the old <em>Latin</em> Poets<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> bragged, that their Verſes<br />
were tougher than Braſs, and harder than<br />
Marble ; what would they have done, if they<br />
had ſeen theſe ? Verily they would have had<br />
more reaſon to wiſh themſelves an hundred<br />
Throats, than they then had, to pronounce them.</p>
<p>There are ſome, that drive a Trade in writ-<br />
ing in praiſe of other Writers, (like Rooks,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Exegi monumentum ære perennius</em><br />
<em>Regalique ſitu Pyramidum altius</em>      <em>Hor</em>. L. 3. O. 30</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>that bet on Gameſters Hands) not at all to ce- lebrate the learned Author's Merits, as they would ſhew, but their own Wits, of which he is but the Subjec_t. The Letchery of this Va- nity has ſpawned more Writers than the * civil Law: * For thoſe, whoſe Modeſty muſt notorious Va- pours imaginable. For if the Privilege of Love be allowed--* Dicere quae* puduit, ſcribere juſſit Amor,* why ſhould it not be ſo in Self- Love too? For if it be Wiſdom to conceal our Imperfec_tions, what is it to diſcover our Vir- tues? It is not like, that * Nature * gave Men great Parts upon ſuch Terms, as the * Fairies <em> uſe to give Money, to pinch and leave them if they ſpeak of it. They ſay--</em>Praiſe is but the Shadow of Virtue; * and ſure that Virtue is very foolish, that is afraid of its own Shadow.</p>
<p>When he writes * Anograms, * he uſes to lay the Outſides of his Verſes even (like a Brick-</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>layer) by a Line of Rhime and Acroſtic, and fill th eMiddle with Rubbiſh--In this he imi- tates * Ben Johnson, * but in nothing elſe.</p>
<p>There was one, that lined a Hat-Caſe with a Paper of * Benlowſe'<em>s Poetry--</em> Prynne * bought it by Chance, and put a new Demi-Caſtor into it. The firſt Time he wore it he felt only a ſinging in his Head, which within two Days turned to a Vertigo--He was let Blood in the Ear by one of the State-Phyſicians, and reco- vered; but before he went abroad he writ a Poem of Rocks and Seas, in a Stile ſo proper and natural, that it was hard to determine, which was ruggeder.</p>
<p>There is no Fear of Ac_tivity, nor Gambol of Wit, that ever was performed by Man, from him that vaults on * Pegasus, * to him that tumbles through the Hoop of an Anagram, but * Benlows * has got the Maſtery in it, whether it be high-rope Wit, or low-rope Wit. He</p>
<p>son means was .......</p>
<hr />
<p>has all Sorts of * Echoes, Rebus's, Chronograms,/ &amp;c.* beſides * Carwichets, Clenches, * and * Quibbles--<em>/ As for </em> Altars * and * Pyramids * in Poetry, he has/ out-done all Men that Way; for he has/ made a * Gridiron, * and a * Frying-Pan * in Verſe,/ that, beſide the Likeneſs in Shape, the very/ Tone and Sound of the Words did perfec_tly/ repreſent the Noiſe, that is made by thoſe/ Utenſils, ſuch as the old Poet called * ſartago lo-/ quendi. * When he was Captain, he made all/ the Furniture of his Horſe, from the Bit to/ the Crupper, in beaten Poetry, every Verſe/ being fitted to the Proportion of the Thing,/ with a moral Alluſion of the Senſe to the/ Thing; as the * Bridle of Moderation, the Saddle/ of Content, * and * the Crupper of Conſtancy;* ſo that/ the ſame Thing was both Epigram and Emblem,/ even as Mule is both Horſe and Aſs.</p>
<p>Some Critics are of Opinion, that Poets/ ought to apply themselves to the Imitation of/ * Nature, * and make a Conſcience of digreſſing/ from her; but he is none of theſe. The an-/ tient Magicians could charm down the Moon,/ and force Rivers back to their Springs by the/</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>Power of Poetry only; and the Moderns will/ undertake to turn the Inſide of the Earh out-/ ward (like a Jugler's Pocket) and ſhake the/ Chesſ out of it, make * Nature * ſhew Tricks like/ an Ape, and the Stars run on Errands; but/ ſtill it is by dint of Poetry. And if Poets can/ so ſuch noble Feats, they were unwiſe to deſ-/ cend to mean and vulgar: For where the rareſt/ and moſt common Things are of a Price (as/ they are all one to Poets) it argues Diſease in/ Judgement not to chuſe the most curious. Hence/ ſome infer, that the Account they give of things/ deſerves no Regard, becauſe they never receive/ any Thing, as they find it, into their Compo-/ ſitions, unleſs it agree both with the Meaſure/ of their own Fancis, and the Meaſure of their/ Lines, which can very ſeldom happen: And/ therefore when they give a Character of any/ Thing or Perſon, it does commonly bear no/ more Proportions to the Subject, than the Fiſhes/ and Ships in a Map do to the Scale. But let/ ſuch know, that Poets, as well as Kings, ought/ rather to conſider what is fit for them to give,/ than others to receive; that they are fain to/ have regard to the Exchange of Language, and/</p>
<hr />
<p>write high or low, according as that runs:/ For in this Age, when the ſmallest Poet ſeldom/ goes below more then moſt, it were a Shame for/ a grater and more noble Poet not to out-throw/ that cut a Bar.</p>
<p>T<sup>2</sup>here was a * Tobacco-Man, * that wrapped / <em>Spaniſh </em> Tobacco in a Paper of Verſes, which/ <em>Benlows</em> had written againſt the * Pope, * which/ by a natural Antipathy, that his Wit has to / any Thing that's Catholic, ſpoiled the Tobacco;/ for it preſently turned Mundungus. This Au-/ thor will take an * English * Word, and, like the/ * Frenchman, * that ſwallowed Water and ſpit it/ out Wine, with a little Heaving and Straining/ would turn it immediately into * Latin,* as * plun-/ derat ille Domos<em>--Mille </em> Hocopokiana, * and a thou-/ ſand ſuch./ / ##There was a young Practitioner in Poetry,/ that found there was no good to be done with-/ out a Miſtreſs: For he, that writes of Love/ before he hath tried it, doth but travel by the/ Map; and he, that makes Love without a/ Dame, does like a Gameſter, that plays for/ / #*More the moſt] There is an appearance Defect or Error in theſe/ Words; but I leave it to the Reader to ſupply or correct./</p>
<hr />
<p>Nothing. He thought it convenient therefore,/ firſt to furniſh himſelf with a Name for his/ Miſstress beforehand, that he might not be to/ ſeek, when his Merit or good Fortune ſhould/ beſtow her upon him: for every Poet is his/ miſtreſſe's Godfather, and gives her a new/ Name, like a Nun that takes Orders. He was/ very curious to ſit himself with a handſome/ Word of a turnable Sound; but could light/ upon none, that ſome Poet or other had not / made uſe of before. He was therefore forced/ to fall to coining, and was ſeveral Months be-/ fore he could light on one, that pleaſed him/ perfectly. But after he had overcome that Dif-/ ficulty, he found a greater remaining, to get a/ Lady to own him. He accoſted ſome of all/ Sorts, and gave them to underſtand, both in/ Proſe and Verſe, how incomparably happy it/ was in his Power to make his Miſtreſs, but/ could never convert any of them. At length/ he was fain to make his Landreſs ſupply that/ Place as Proxy, until his good Fortune, or/ ſomebody of better Quality would be more / kind to him, which after a while he neither/ hoped nor cared for; for how mean Toever her/ Condition was before, when he had once pre-/ tended to her, ſhe was ſure to be a Nymph and/</p>
<hr />
<p>a Goddeſs. For what greater Honour can a/ Woman be capable of, than to be tranſlated/ into precious Stones and Stars? No Herald in/ the World can go higher. Beſides se found no/ Man can uſe that Freedom of Hyperbole in the/ Character of a Perſon commonly known (as/ great Ladies are) which we can in deſcribing/ one ſo obſcure and unknown, that nobody can/ diſprove him. For he, that writes but one/ Sonnet upon any of the public Perſons, ſhall/ be ſure to have his Reader at ever third Word/ cry out--What an Aſs is this to call * Spaniſh/ paper and Ceruſe Lillies and Roſes, * or * claps In-/ fluences--* To ſay, * the Graces are her waiting Wo-/ men, * when they are known to be no better/ than her Bawdes--that * Day breaks from her/ Eyes, <em>when ſhe looks aſquint--Or that </em> her/ Breath perfumes the Arabian Winds, * when ſhe/ puffs Tobacco?/ / ##It is no mean Art to improve a Language,/ and find out Words, that are not only removed/ from common uſe, but rich in Conſonanats,/ the Nerves and Sinews of Speech, to raiſe a/ / ---</p>
<hr />
<p>ſft and feeble Language like ours to the Pitch/ of * High-Dutch,* as he did, that writ</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arts rattling Foreſkins ſhrilling Bagpipes quell.*/</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the only the moſt elegant, but moſt po-/ litic Way of Writing, that a Poet can uſe; for I/ know no Defence like it to preſerve a Poem from/ the Torture of thoſe that liſp and ſtammer./ He that wants Teeth may as well venture upon/ a Piece of tough horny Brawn as ſuch a Line,/ for he will look like an Aſs eating Thiſtles.</p>
<p>He never begins a Work without an Invoca-/ tion of his * Muse; * for it is not fit that ſhe ſhould/ appear in public, to ſhew her Skill before ſhe/ is entreated, as Gentlewomen do not uſe to / ſing, until they are applied to, and often deſired.</p>
<p>I ſhall not need to ſay any this of the Ex-/ cellence of Poetry, ſince it has been already/ performed by many excellent Perſons, among/ whom ſome have lately undertaken to prove, that/ the civil Government cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt with-/ out it, which, for my Part, I believe to be true</p>
<ul>
<li>ſome have lately. <em>] This alludes to </em> Davenant--See * G---</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>in a poetical Senſe, and more probable to be/ received of it, than thoſe ſtrange Feats of/ building Walls and making Trees dance,/ which Antiquity aſcribes to Verſe. And though/ * Philoſophers * are of a contrary Opinion, and will/ not allow Poets fit to live in a Commonwealth,/ their Partiality is plainer than their Reaſons;/ for they have no other Way to pretend to this/ Prerogative themſelves, as they do, but by re-/ moving Poets, whom they know to have a/ fairer Title; and this they do unjuſtly, that/ * Plato, * who firſt baniſhed Poets his Republic,/ forgot that the very Commonwealth was poe-/ tical. I ſhall ſay nothing to them, but only/ deſire the World to conſider, how happily it is/ like to be governed by thoſe, that are as ſo per-/ petual a civil War among themſelves, that if we/ ſhould ſubmit ourſelves to their own Reſolution/ of this Question, and be content to allow them/ only fit to rule if they could but conclude it/ ſo themselves, they would never agree upon it--/ Mean while there is no leſs Certainty and Agree-/ ment in Poetry than the Mathematics; for they/ all ſubmit the to the ſame Rules without Diſpute or/ Controverſy. But whoſoever ſhall pleaſe to look/ into the Records of Antiquity ſhall find their/ Title ſo unqueſtioned, that the greatest Princess</p>
<hr />
<p>in the whole World have been glad to derive/ their Pedigrees, and their Power too, from/ Poets. * Alexander * the great had no wiſer a Way/ so ſecure the Empire to himſelf by * Right, <em>/ which he had gotten by </em> Force, * then by de-/ claring himſelf the Son of * Jupiter; * and who/ was * Jupiter * but the Son of a Poet? So * Caeſar <em>/ and all </em> Rome * was transported with Joy, when a/ Poet made * Jupiter * his Colleague in the Empire;/ and when * Jupiter * governed, what did the/ Poets, that governed Jupiter?</p>
