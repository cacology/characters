SMALL POET</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S one, that would fain make himſelf that,<br />
which <em>Nature</em> never meant him ; like a <em>Fa-</em><br />
<em>natic</em>, that inſpires himſelf with his own<br />
Whimſies. He ſets up Haberdaſher of ſmall<br />
Poetry, with a very ſmall Stock, and no Credit.<br />
He believes it is Invention enough to find out<br />
other Men’s Wit ; and whatſoever he lights upon<br />
either in Books, or Company, he makes bold<br />
with as his own. This he puts together ſo un-<br />
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit<br />
has the Rickets, by the ſwelling Diſproportion<br />
of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of<br />
him ; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that<br />
he has catched of others ; and his Flame like<br />
that of Charcoals, that were burnt before :<br />
But as he wants Judgment to underſtand what<br />
is beſt, he naturally takes the worſt, as being<br />
moſt agreeable to his own Talent. You may<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>know his Wit not to be natural, ’tis ſo un-<br />
quiet and troubleſome in him : For as thoſe,<br />
that have Money but ſeldom, are always ſhak-<br />
ing their Pockets, when they have it ; ſo does<br />
he, when he thinks he has got ſomething, that<br />
will make him appear. He is a perpetual Tal-<br />
ker ; and you may know by the Freedom of his<br />
Diſcourſe, that he came light by it, as Thieves<br />
ſpend freely what they get. He meaſures other<br />
Men’s Wits by <em>their</em> Modeſty, and his own by<br />
<em>his</em> Confidence. He makes nothing of writing<br />
Plays, becauſe he has not Wit enough to un-<br />
derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-<br />
ture to talk and ſcribble, as Chowſes do to play<br />
with cunning Gameſters, until they are cheated<br />
and laughed at. He is always talking of Wit,<br />
as thoſe, that have bad Voices, are always ſing-<br />
ing out of Tune ; and thoſe, that cannot play,<br />
delight to fumble on Inſtruments. He grows<br />
the unwiſer by other Men’s Harms ; for the<br />
worſe others write, he finds the more Encou-<br />
ragement to do ſo too. His Greedineſs of<br />
Praiſe is ſo eager, that he ſwallows any Thing,<br />
that comes in the Likeneſs of it, how notorious<br />
and palpable ſoever, and is as Shot-free againſt<br />
any Thing, that may leſſen his good Opinion<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>of himſelf---This renders him incurable, like<br />
Diſeaſes, that grow inſenſible.</p>
<p>If you diſlike him it is at your own Peril ;<br />
he is ſure to put in a Caveat beforehand againſt<br />
your Understanding ; and, like a Malefactor<br />
in Wit, is always furniſhed with Exceptions<br />
againſt his Judges. This puts him upon perpe-<br />
tual Apologies, Excuſes, and Defences, but<br />
ſtill by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-<br />
fling Strain, without Regard of any Man,<br />
that ſtands in the Way of his Pageant.<br />
Where he thinks he may do it ſafely, he<br />
will confidently own other Men’s Writings ;<br />
and where he fears the Truth may be diſcovered,<br />
he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inſinua-<br />
tions give Men Occaſion to ſuppoſe ſo.</p>
<p>If he underſtands <em>Latin</em> or <em>Greek</em> he ranks<br />
himſelf among the Learned, deſpiſes the Igno-<br />
rant, talks Criticiſms out of <em>Scaliger</em>, and re-<br />
peats <em>Martial</em>'s baudy Epigrams, and ſets up<br />
his Reſt wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be<br />
not ſo well qualified, he crys down all Learning<br />
as pedantic, diſclaims Study, and profeſſes to<br />
write with as great Facility, as if his Muſe was<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>ſliding down <em>Parnaſſus</em>. Whatſoever he hears<br />
well ſaid<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> he ſeizes upon by poetical Licence ;<br />
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill<br />
repeating of it---This he believes to be no<br />
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others<br />
throw away. By this means his Writings are,<br />
like a Taylor’s Cuſhion, of moſaic Work,<br />
made up of ſeveral Scraps ſewed together.<br />
He calls a ſlovenly naſty Deſcription <em>great Na-</em><br />
<em>ture</em>, and dull Flatneſs <em>strange Eaſineſs</em>. He<br />
writes down all that comes in his Head, and<br />
makes no Choice, becauſe he has nothing to<br />
do it with, that is Judgment. He is always<br />
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like<br />
the <em>long Parliament</em> making <em>Ordinances</em> in their<br />
Stead ; although they are perpetually <em>thrown</em><br />
<em>out</em> of Coffee-Houſes, and come to Nothing.<br />
He is like an <em>Italian</em> Thief, that never robs,<br />
but he murthers, to prevent Diſcovery ; ſo ſure<br />
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-<br />
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may paſs<br />
unſuſpected. He is but a Copier at beſt, and<br />
will never arrive to practice by the Life : For<br />
bar him the Imitation of ſomething he has<br />
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.</p>
<hr />
<p>Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form<br />
of juſt Wit, are above his Philoſophy. He<br />
appears ſo over concerned in all Men’s Wits,<br />
as if they were but Diſparagements of his<br />
own ; and crys down all they do, as if they<br />
were Encroachments upon him. He takes<br />
Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them, as<br />
<em>Justices</em> do falſe Weights, and Pots that want<br />
Meaſure. When he meets with any Thing,<br />
that is very good, he changes it into ſmall<br />
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to<br />
ſerve ſeveral Occaſions. He diſclaims Study,<br />
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to ſhoot<br />
flying, which appears to be very true by his<br />
often miſſing of his Mark. His Wit is much<br />
troubled with Obſtructions ; and he has Fits as<br />
painful as thoſe of the Spleen. He fancies him-<br />
ſelf a dainty ſpruce Shepherd, with a Flock and<br />
a fine ſilken Shepherdeſs, that follows his Pipe,<br />
as Rats did the Conjurers in <em>Germany</em>.</p>
<p>As for <em>Epithets</em>, he always avoids thoſe, that<br />
are near akin to the Senſse. Such matches are<br />
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a <em>Chriſtian</em><br />
Poet ; and therefore all his Care is to chuſe out<br />
[^2]: [<em>footnote cont'd from prev. page</em>] <em>Quem recitas meus eſt, O Fidentine, libellus :</em><br />
<em>Sed male dum recitas, incipit eſſe tuus.    Mart. L. 1. Ep. 39.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>ſuch, as will ſerve, like a wooden Leg, to piece<br />
out a main’d Verſe, that wants a Foot or two ;<br />
and if they will but rhimes now and then into<br />
the Bargain, or run upon a Letter, it is a Work<br />
of Supererrogation.</p>
<p>For <em>Similitudes</em>, he likes the hardeſt and moſt<br />
obſcure beſt : For as Ladies wear black Patches,<br />
to make their Complexions ſeem fairer than<br />
they are ; ſo when an Illuſtration is more ob-<br />
ſcure than the Senſe that went before it, it muſt<br />
of Neceſſity make it appear clearer than it<br />
did : For Contraries are beſt ſet off with Con-<br />
traries.</p>
<p>He has found out a Way to ſave the Expence<br />
of much Wit and Senſe : For he will make<br />
leſs than ſome have prodigally laid out upon<br />
five or ſix Words ſerve forty or fifty Lines.<br />
This is a thrifty Invention, and very eaſy ; and,<br />
if it were commonly known, would much in-<br />
creaſe the Trade of Wit, and maintain a Mul-</p>
<hr />
<p>titude of ſmall Poets in conſtant Employment.<br />
He has found out a new Sort of poetical <em>Geor-</em><br />
<em>gics</em>, a Trick of ſowing Wit like clover-graſs<br />
on barren Subjects, which would yield nothing<br />
before. This is very uſeful for the Times,<br />
wherein, ſome Men ſay, there is no Room left<br />
for new Invention. He will take three Grains<br />
of Wit like the Elixir, and projecting it upon<br />
the <em>Iron-Age</em> turn it immediately into <em>Gold---</em><br />
All the Buſineſs of Mankind has preſently<br />
vaniſhed, the whole World has kept Holiday ;<br />
there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,<br />
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdeſſes ;<br />
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed<br />
Plum-Porrige.</p>
<p>We read that <em>Virgil</em> uſed to make<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> fifty or<br />
ſixty Verſes in a Morning, and afterwards re-<br />
duce them to ten. This was an unthrifty<br />
Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the<br />
Huſbandry of his own Poetry, as <em>Seneca</em> ſays<br />
he was in that of a Farm ;<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> for in plain <em>Engliſh</em></p>
<hr />
<p>it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine-<br />
pence. And as ſuch Courſes brought the<br />
<em>prodigal Son</em> to eat with Hogs : So they did him<br />
to feed with Horſes,<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> which were not much<br />
better Company, and may teach us to avoid<br />
doing the like. For certainly it is more noble<br />
to take four or five Grains of Senſe, and, like<br />
a Gold-Beater, hammer them into ſo many<br />
Leaves as will fill a whole Book ; than to write<br />
nothing but Epitomies, which many wiſe Men<br />
believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.</p>
<p>When he writes, he commonly ſteers the<br />
Senſe of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the<br />
End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the<br />
Tail. For when he has made one Line, which<br />
is eaſy enough ; and has found out ſome ſturdy<br />
hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham-<br />
mer the Senſe upon it, like a Piece of hot Iron<br />
upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleaſes.</p>
<p>There is no Art in the World ſo rich in<br />
Terms as Poetry ; a whole Dictionary is ſcarce</p>
<hr />
<p>able to contain them : For there is hardly a<br />
Pond, a Sheep-walk, or a Gravel-pit in all<br />
<em>Greece</em>, but the antient Name of it is become<br />
a Term of Art in Poetry. By this means ſmall<br />
Poets have ſuch a Stock of able hard Words lying<br />
by them, as <em>Dryades</em>, <em>Hamadryades</em>, <em>Aonides</em>, <em>Fauni</em>,<br />
<em>Nymphae</em>, <em>Sylvani</em>, <em>&amp;c</em>. that ſignify nothing at all ;<br />
and ſuch a World of pedantic Terms of the<br />
ſame Kind, as may ſerve to furniſh all the new<br />
Inventions and <em>thorough-Reformations</em>, that can<br />
happen between this and <em>Plato</em>’s great Year.</p>
<p>When he writes he never propoſes any Scope<br />
or Purpoſe to himſelf, but gives his Genius all<br />
Freedom : For as he, that rides abroad for his<br />
Pleaſure, can hardly be out of his Way ; ſo he<br />
that writes for his Pleaſure, can ſeldom be be-<br />
ſide his Subject. It is an ungrateful Thing to<br />
a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing---<br />
To what Purpoſe did the Antients feign <em>Pegaſus</em><br />
to have Wings, if he muſt be confined to the<br />
Road and Stages like a Pack-Horſe, or be forced<br />
to be obedient to Hedges and Ditches? There-</p>
<hr />
<p>fore he has no Reſpect to Decorum and Pro-<br />
priety of Circumſtance ; for the Regard of<br />
Perſons, Times, and Places is a Reſtraint too<br />
ſervile to be impoſed upon poetical Licence ;<br />
like him that made <em>Plato</em><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> confeſs <em>Juvenal</em> to be<br />
a Philoſopher, or <em>Perſius</em>, that calls the <em>Athe</em>-<br />
<em>nians Quirites</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>Metaphors</em>, he uſes to chuſe the hardeſt,<br />
and moſt far-fet that he can light upon---Theſe<br />
are the Jewels of Eloquence, and therefore the<br />
harder they are, the more precious they muſt<br />
be.</p>
<p>He’ll take ſcant Piece of coarſe Senſe, and<br />
ſtretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a ſcore<br />
Rhimes, until it crack that you may ſee through<br />
it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head. When<br />
you ſee his Verſes hanged up in Tobacco-Shops,<br />
you may ſay, in defiance of the Proverb, <em>that</em><br />
<em>the weakeſt does not always go to the Wall</em> ; for ’tis</p>
<hr />
<p>well known the Lines are ſtrong enough, and<br />
in that Senſe may juſtly take the Wall of any,<br />
that have been written in our Language. He<br />
ſeldom makes a Conſcience of his Rhimes ; but<br />
will often take the Liberty to make <em>preach</em><br />
rhime with <em>Cheat</em>, <em>Vote</em> with <em>Rogue</em>, and <em>Com</em>-<br />
<em>mittee-Man</em> with <em>Hang</em>.</p>
<p>He’ll make one Word of as many Joints, as<br />
the Tin-Pudding, that a Jugler pulls out of<br />
his Throat, and chops in again---What think<br />
you of <em>glud-fum-flam-hasta-minantes ?</em> Some of<br />
the old <em>Latin</em> Poets<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> bragged, that their Verſes<br />
were tougher than Braſs, and harder than<br />
Marble ; what would they have done, if they<br />
had ſeen theſe ? Verily they would have had<br />
more reaſon to wiſh themſelves an hundred<br />
Throats, than they then had, to pronounce them.</p>
<p>There are ſome, that drive a Trade in writ-<br />
ing in praiſe of other Writers, (like Rooks,</p>
