<h1 id="a-ribald">A<br />
RIBALD</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S the Devil’s Hypocrite, the endeavours to<br />
make himſelf appear worſe than he is. His<br />
evil Words and bad Manners ſtrive which<br />
ſhall moſt corrupt one another, and it is hard<br />
to ſay which has the Advantage. He vents<br />
his Lechery at the Mouth, as ſome Fiſhes are<br />
ſaid to engender. He is an unclean Beaſt that<br />
chews the Cud ; for after he has ſatisfied his<br />
Lust, he brings it up again into his Mouth<br />
to a ſecond Enjoyment, and plays an After-<br />
game of Letchery with his Tongue much worſe<br />
than that which the <em>Cunnilingi</em> uſed among the<br />
old <em>Romans.</em> He ſtrips Nature ſtark-naked, and<br />
clothes her in the moſt fantaſtic and ridiculous<br />
Faſhion a wild Imagination can invent. He<br />
is worſe and more naſty than a Dog ; for<br />
in his broad Deſcriptions of others obſcene<br />
Actions he does but lick up the Vomit of ano-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>ther Man’s Surfeits. He tells Tales out of a<br />
vaulting School. A leud baudy Tale does<br />
more Hurt, and gives a worſe Example than<br />
the Thing of which it was told ; for the Act<br />
extends but to a few, and if it be concealed<br />
goes no further ; but the Report of it is un-<br />
limited, and may be conveyed to all People,<br />
and all Times to come. He expoſes that with<br />
his Tongue, which Nature gave Women Mo-<br />
deſty, and brute Beaſts Tails to cover. He<br />
miſtakes Ribaldry for Wit, though nothing is<br />
more unlike, and believes himſelf to be the<br />
finer Man the filthier he talks ; as if he were<br />
above Civility, as <em>Fanatics</em> are above Ordinan-<br />
ces, and held nothing more ſhameful than to be<br />
aſhamed of any Thing. He talks nothing but<br />
<em>Aretine</em>’s Pictures, as plain as the <em>Scotch</em> Dia-<br />
lect, which is eſteemed to be the moſt copious<br />
and elegant of the Kind. He improves and<br />
huſbands his Sins to the beſt Advantage,<br />
and makes one Vice find Employment for<br />
another ; for what he acts looſely in private,<br />
he talks as looſely of in public, and finds as<br />
much Pleaſure in the one as the other. He<br />
endeavours to make himſelf Satisfaction for<br />
the Pangs his Claps and Botches put him to with<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>vapouring and bragging how he came by<br />
them. He endeavours to purchaſe himſelf a<br />
Reputation by pretending to that which the<br />
beſt Men abominate, and the worſt value not,<br />
like one that clips and waſhes falſe Coin, and<br />
ventures his Neck for that which will yield<br />
him nothing.<br />
