<p>[Double line capital]Is one that wears his Feather on the Ins<em>ide<br />
of his Head. His Brain is like Quicks</em>ilver,<br />
apt to receive any Impres<em>s</em>ion, but retain none.<br />
His Mind is made of changeable Stuff, that<br />
alters Colour with every Motion towards the<br />
Light. He is a Cormorant, that has but one<br />
Gut, devours every Thing greedily, but it runs<br />
through him immediately. He does not know<br />
s<em>o much as what he would be, and yet would<br />
be every Thing he knows. He is like a Paper-<br />
Lanthorn, that turns with the Smoak of a<br />
Candle. He wears his Cloaths, as the antient<br />
Laws of the Land have provided, according<br />
to his Quality, that he may be known what<br />
he is by them; and it is as eas</em>y to decipher<br />
him by his Habit as a [i] Pudding. He is rigg'd<br />
with Ribbon, and his Garniture is his Tackle;<br />

all the res<em>t of him is Hull. He is s</em>ure to be<br />
the earlies<em>t in the Fas</em>hion, as others are of<br />
a Faction, and glories as much to be in the<br />
Head of a Mode, as a Solider does to be in<br />
the Head of an Army. He is admirably s<em>kil-<br />
ful in the Mathematics of Cloaths; and can<br />
tell, at the firs</em>t View, whether they have the<br />
right Symmetry. He alters his Gate with the<br />
Times, and has not a Motion of his Body, that<br />
(like a Dottrel) he does not borrow from s<em>ome-<br />
body els</em>e. He exercis<em>es his Limbs, like the<br />
Pike and Mus</em>ket, and all his Pos<em>tures are prac-<br />
tis</em>ed--Take him all together, and he is nothing<br />
but a Trans<em>lation, Word for Word, out of<br />
[i] French, [i] an Image cas</em>t in Plas<em>ter of [i] Paris, [i] and<br />
a Puppet s</em>ent over for others to dres<em>s thems</em>elves<br />
by. He s<em>peaks [i] French, [i] as Pedants do [i] Latin, [i]<br />
to s</em>hew his Breeding; and mos<em>t naturally,<br />
where he is leas</em>t unders<em>tood. All his non-Na_<br />
turals, on which his Health and Dis</em>eases de-<br />
pend, are [i] s<em>tile novo. French [i] is his Holiday-Lan-<br />
guage, that he wears for his Pleas</em>ure and Or-<br />
nament, and us<em>es [i] English [i] only for his Bus</em>ines<em>s<br />
and neces</em>s<em>ary Occas</em>ions. He is like a [i] Scotch-<br />
man, [i] though he is born a Subject of his own<br />

him.<br />

#indent He is never quiet, but s<em>its as the Wind is<br />
s</em>aid to do, when it is mos<em>t in Motion. His<br />
Head is as full of Maggots as a Pas</em>toral Poet's<br />
Flock. He was begotten, like one of Pliny's<br />
Portugues<em>e Hors</em>es, by the Wind--The Truth<br />
is he ought not to have been reared; for being<br />
calved in the Increas<em>e of the Moon, he Head<br />
is troubled with a ---<br />
