<h1 id="a-quaker">A<br />
QUAKER</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S a Scoundrel Saint, of an Order without<br />
Founder, Vow, or Rule ; for he will not<br />
ſwear, nor be tyed to any Thing, but his own<br />
Humour. He is the Link-Boy of the Sectaries,<br />
and talks much of his Light, but puts it under<br />
a Buſhel, for nobody can ſee it but himſelf. His<br />
Religion is but the cold Fit of an Ague, and his<br />
Zeal of a contrary Temper to that of all others,<br />
yet produces the ſame Effects ; as cold Iron in<br />
<em>Greenland</em>, they ſay, burns as well as hot ;<br />
which makes him delight, like a Salamander,<br />
to live in the Fire of Perſecution. He works<br />
out his Salvation, not with <em>Fear</em>, but <em>Confidence</em><br />
<em>and Trembling</em>. His Profeſſion is but a Kind<br />
of Winter-Religion ; and the Original of it as<br />
uncertain as the hatching of Woodcocks, for<br />
no Man can tell from whence it came. He<br />
Vapours much of the Light within him, but<br />
no ſuch Thing appears, unleſs he means as he<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>is light-headed. He believes he takes up the<br />
Croſs in being croſs to all Mankind. He de_<br />
lights in Perſecution, as ſome old extravagant<br />
Fornicators find a Lechery in being whipt ;<br />
and has no Ambition but to go to Heaven in<br />
what he calls a fiery Chariot, that is, a Wood-<br />
monger’s Faggot Cart. You may perceive he<br />
has a Crack in his Skill by the flat Twang of<br />
his Noſe, and the great Care he takes to keep<br />
his Hat on, leſt his ſickly Brains, if he have<br />
any, ſhould take Cold at it. He believes his<br />
Doctrine to be heavenly, becauſe it agrees per-<br />
fectly with the <em>Motus Trepidationis</em>. All his<br />
Hopes are in the <em>Turks</em> overrunning of Chriſ-<br />
tendom, becauſe he has heard they count Fools<br />
and Madmen Saints, and doubts not to paſs<br />
muſter with them for great Abilities that Way.<br />
This makes him believe he can convert the <em>Turk</em>,<br />
tho’ he could do no good on the <em>Pope</em>, or the<br />
<em>Preſbyterian</em>. Nothing comes ſo near his quak-<br />
ing Liturgy, as the Papiſtical Poſſeſſions of the<br />
<em>Devil</em>, with which it conforms in Diſcipline<br />
exact. His Church, or rather Chapel, is built<br />
upon a flat Sand, without ſuperior or inferior<br />
in it, and not upon a Rock, which is never<br />
found without great Inequalities. Next De_<br />
moniacs he moſt reſembles the Reprobate, who<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>are ſaid to be condemned to Weeping and<br />
Gnaſhing of Teeth. There was a Botcher of<br />
their Church, that renounced his Trade and<br />
turned Preacher, becauſe he held it ſuperſtiti-<br />
ous to ſit <em>croſs-legged</em>. His Devotion is but a<br />
Kind of ſpiritual Palſy, that proceeds from a<br />
Diſtemper in the Brain, where the Nerves are<br />
rooted. They abhor the Church of <em>England</em>,<br />
but conform exactly with thoſe primitive Fa-<br />
theres of their Church, that heretofore gave An-<br />
ſwers at the <em>Devil</em>’s Oracles, in which they ob-<br />
ſerved the very ſame Ceremony of quaking and<br />
and gaping now practiſed by our modern En_<br />
thuſiaſts at their Exorciſms, rather than Ex-<br />
erciſes of Devotion. He ſucks in the Air like<br />
a Pair of Bellows, and blows his inward Light<br />
with it, till he dung Fire, as Cattle do in <em>Lin</em>-<br />
<em>colnſhire</em>. The general Ignorance of their<br />
whole Party make it appear, that whatſoever<br />
their Zeal may be, it is not <em>according to Know</em>-<br />
<em>ledge</em>.<br />
