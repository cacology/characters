<h1 id="an-imitator">An<br />
Imitator</h1>
<p><sup>I</sup>s a counterfeit Stone, and the larger and<br />
fairer he appears the more apt he is to be<br />
diſcovered, whilſt ſmall ones, that pretend to no great Value, paſs unſuſpected. He is made<br />
like a Man in Arras-Hangings, after ſome great<br />
Maſter’s Deſign, though far ſhort of the Ori<br />
ginal. He is like a Spectrum or walking<br />
Spirit that aſſumes the Shape of ſome particular<br />
Peſson, and appears in the Likeneſs of ſome-<br />
thing that he is not, becauſe he has no Shape<br />
of his own to put on. He has a Kind of<br />
Monkey and Baboon Wit, that takes after ſome<br />
Man’s Way, whom he endeavors to imitate,<br />
but does it worſse than thoſe Things that are na-<br />
turally his own; for he does not learn but<br />
take his Pattern out, as a Girl does her Sam-<br />
pler. His whole Life is nothing but a Kind of<br />
Education, and he is always learning to be<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>ſomething that he is not, nor ever will be: For<br />
Nature is free, and will not be forced out of<br />
her Way, nor compelled to do any Thing<br />
againſt her own Will and Inclination. He is<br />
but a Retainer to Wit, and a Follower of his<br />
Maſter, whoſe Badge he wears every where,<br />
and therefore his Way is called <em>ſervile Imitation.</em><br />
His Fancy is like the innocent Lady’s; who by<br />
looking on the Picture of a <em>Moor</em> that hung<br />
in her Chamber conceived a Child of the ſame<br />
Complexion; for all his Conceptions are pro-<br />
duced by the Pictures of other Men’s Imagi-<br />
nations, and by their Features betray whoſe<br />
Baſtards they are. His Muſe is not inſpired<br />
but infected with another Man’s Fancy; and<br />
he catches his Wit, like the Itch, of ſomebody<br />
elſe that had it before, and when he writes he<br />
does but ſcratch himſelf. His Head is, like<br />
his Hat, faſhioned upon a Block, and wrought<br />
in a Shape of another Man’s Invention. He<br />
melts down his Wit, and caſts it in a Mold:<br />
and as metals melted and caſt are not ſo firm<br />
and ſolid, as thoſe that are wrought with the<br />
Hammer; ſo thoſe Compoſitions, that are<br />
founded and run in other Men’s Molds, are<br />
always more brittle and looſe than thoſe, that<br />
are forged in a Man’s own Brain. He binds<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>himſelf Prentice to a Trade, which he has no<br />
Stock to ſet up with, if he ſhould ſerve out his<br />
Time, and live to be made free. He runs a<br />
whoring after another Man’s Inventions (for he<br />
has none of his own to tempt him to an incon-<br />
tinent Thought) and begets a Kind of Mun-<br />
grel Breed, that never comes to good.<br />
