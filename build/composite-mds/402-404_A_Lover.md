#A\
LOVER

I^2^S a Kind of *Goth* and *Vandal*, that leaves\
his native Self to ſettle in another, or a\
Planter that forſakes his Country, where he\
was born, to labour and dig in *Virginia*.\
His Heart is catched in a Net with a Pair of\
bringht ſhining Eyes, as Larks are with Pieces\
of a looking-Glaſs.  He makes heavy Com_\
plaints againſt it for deſerting of him, and\
deſires to have another in Exchange for it,\
which is a very unreaſonable Requeſt ; for if\
it betrayed its boſom Friend, what will it do\
to a Stranger, that ſhould give it Truſt and\
Entertainment ?  He binds himſelf, and cries\
out he is robbed of his Heart, and charges the\
Innocent with it, only to get a good Com-\
poſition, or another for it, againſt Con-\
ſcience and Honeſty.  He talks much of his\

Flame, and pretends to be burnt by his Miſ-\
treſs’s Eyes, for which he requires Satisfaction\
from her, like one that ſets his Houſe on Fire\
to get a Brief for charitable Contributions.\
He makes his Miſtreſs all of Stars, and when\
ſhe is unkind, rails at them, as if they did ill\
Offices between them, and being of her Kin\
ſet her againſt him.  He falls in Love as Men\
fall ſick when their Bodies are inclined to it,\
and imputes that to his Miſtreſſes Charms,\
which is really in his own Temper ; for when\
that is altered, the other vaniſhes of it ſelf, and\
therefore one ſaid not amiſs,

------The Lilly and the Roſe\
Not in her Cheeks, but in thy Temper grows.

When his Deſires are grown up, they ſwarm,\
and fly out to ſeek a new Habitation, and\
whereſoever they light they fix like Bees, among\
which ſome late Philoſophers have obſerved\
that it is a Female that leads all the reſt.  Love\
is but a Clap of the Mind, a Kind of run-\
ning of the Fancy, that breaks out, if it be\
not ſtopped in Time, into Botches of heroic\
Rime ; for all Loverrs are poets for the Time\

being, and make their Ladies a Kind of mo-\
ſaic Work of ſeveral coloured Stones joined\
together by a ſtrong Fancy, but very ſtiff and\
unnatural ; and though they ſteal Stars from\
Heaven, as *Prometheus* did Fire, to animate\
them, all will not make them alive, nor\
alives-liking.\
