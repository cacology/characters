#A\
VINTNER

H^2^ANGS out his Buſh to ſhew he has not\
good Wine ; for that, the Proverb ſays,
needs it not.  If wine were as neceſſary as\
Bread, he would ſtand in the Pillory for ſelling\
falſe Meaſure, as well as Bakers do for falſe\
Weight ; but ſince it is at every Man’s Choice\
to come to his Houſe or not, thoſe that do, are\
guilty of half the Injuries he does them, and\
he believes the reſt to be none at all, becauſe\
no Injury can be done to him, that is willing\
to take it.  He had rather ſell bad Wine, than\
good that ſtands him in no more, for it makes\
Men ſooner drunk, and then they are the eaſier\
over-reckoned.  By the Knaveries he acts\
above-board, which every Man ſees, one may\
eaſily take a Meaſure of thoſe he does under\
Ground in his Cellar ; for he that will pick\
a Man’s Pocket to his Face, will not ſtick to\
uſe him worſe in private when he knows no-\

thing of it.  When he has poiſoned his\
Wines he raiſes his Price, and to make amends\
for that abates his Meaſure, for he thinks it\
a greater Sin to commit Murder for ſmall\
Gains, than a valuable Conſideration.  He\
does not only ſpoil and deſtroy his Wines, but\
an ancient reverend Proverb, with brewing and\
racking, that ſays, *In vino veritas*, for there\
is no Truth in his, but all falſe and ſophiſtica-\
ted ; for he can counterfeit Wine as cunningly\
as *Apelles* did Grapes, and cheat Men with it,\
as *he* did Birds.  He brings every Bottle of\
Wine he draws to the *Bar*, to confeſs it to be\
a Cheat, and afterwards puts himſelf upon\
the Mercy of the Company.  He is an *Anti-*\
*chriſtian* Cheat ; for Chriſt turned Water into\
Wine, and he turns Wine into Water.  He\
ſcores all his Reckonings upon two Tables\
made like thoſe of the ten Commandments, that\
he may be put in Mind to break them as oft as\
poſſibly he can ; eſpecially that of ſtealing and\
bearing falſe Witneſs againſt his Neighbour,\
when he draws him bad Wine and ſwears it is\
good, and that he can take more for the Pipe\
than the Wine will yield him by the Bottle,\
a Trick that a *Jesuit* taught him to cheat his\

own Conſcience with.  When he is found to\
over-reckon notoriouſly, he has one common\
Evaſion for all, and that is to ſay it was a\
Miſtake, by which he means, that he thought\
they had not been ſober enough to diſcover it ;\
for if it had paſt, there had been no Error at\
all in the Caſe.\
