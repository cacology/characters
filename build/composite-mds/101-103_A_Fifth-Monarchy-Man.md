#A\
FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN

I^2^S one, that is not contented to be a Privy-\
Counſellor of the Kingdom of Heaven, but\
would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,\
and tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the\
Kingdom of Earth.  His Deſign is to make\
*Chriſt* King, as his Forefathers the *Jew* did,\
only to abuſe and crucify him, that he might\
ſhare his Lands and Goods, as he did his Vice-\
gerents here.  He dreams of a Fool's Paradiſe\
without a Serpent in it, a golden Age all of\
Saints, and no Hypocrites, all *holy-Court* Princes,\
and no Subjects but the Wicked ;  a Govern-\
ment of *Perkin Warbec* and *Lambert Simnel*\
Saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it,\
might make himſelf a Price, and claim a\
Title to the Crown.  He fancies a *fifth-Mo-*\
*narchy* as the Quinteſſence of all Governments,\
abſtracted from all Matter, and conſiſting\

wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and Myſteries.\
*John* of *Leyden* was the firſt Founder of it, and\
though he miſcarried, like *Romulus* in a Tem-\
peſt, his Poſterity have Revelations every full\
Moon, that there may be a Time to ſet up his\
Title again, and with better Succeſs ; though\
his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had\
no ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,\
but their whole outward Men were ſet on the\
Gates of the City ; where a Head and four\
Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of the\
*fifth-Monarchy.* They have been contriving (ſince\
Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-\
ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed King\
*Oberon,* to erect their Monarchy in *Fairy-Land,*\
as being the moſt proper and natural Region in\
the whole World for their Government, and if\
it ſucceed there to proceed further.  The *De-*\
*vil's* Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,\
and the Glory of them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,\
that they would venture their Necks to take\
him at his Word, and give him his Price.\
Nothing comes ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-\
neſs as the *fifth-Monarchy,* that is no where to\
be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-\
thologies, and myſtical Riddles, like the Vi-\
ſions *Aeneas* ſaw in Hell of the *Roman* Empire.\

Next this it moſt reſembles *Mahomet*’s Coming\
to the *Turks,* and King *Arthur*’s Reign over the\
Britons in *Merlin*’s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin\
are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern\
the ſame Lineaments in them all.  The poor\
Wicked are like to have a very ill time under\
them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-\
vernment, according to their ancient and fun-\
damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects\
but Slaves, who between them and the *Devil*\
are like to ſuffer Perſecution enough to make\
them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-\
ters.  He gathers Churches on the Sunday, as\
the *Jews* did Sticks on their Sabbath, to ſet the\
State on Fire.  He humms and hahs high Trea-\
ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the\
Caſt they would throw.  He groans Sedition,\
and, like the *Phariſee,* rails, when he gives\
Thanks.  He interprets Propheſies, as *Whitting-\
ton* did the Bells, to ſpeak to him, and governs\
himſelf accordingly.\
