[I]s a Native of all Countries, and an Alien at\
[I]Home.  He flies from the Place where he\
was hatched, like a Wildgoos*e, and prefers all\
others before it.  He has no Quarrel to it, but\
becaus*e he was born in it, and like a Bas*tard,\
he is as*hamed of his Mother, becaus*e s*he is of\
him. He is a Merchant, that makes Voyages\
into foreign Nations, to drive a Trade in Wis*-\
dom and Politics, and it is not for his Credit\
to have it thought, he has made an ill Return,\
which mus*t be, if he s*hould allow of any of\
the Growth of his own Country.  This makes\
him quick and blow up hims*elf with Admira-\
tion of foreign Parts, and a generous Con-\
tempt of Home, that all Men may admire, at\
leas*t, the means he has had of Improvement,\
and deplore their own Defects*. His Obs*erva-\
tions are like a Sieve, that lets the finer Flour\
pas*s, and retains only the Bran of Things;\

for his whole Return of Wis*dom proves to be\
but Affectation, a peris*hable Commodity, which\
he will never be able to put off. He believes\
all Men's Wits are at a s*tand, that s*tay at\
Home, and only thos*e advanced, that travel ;\
as if Change of Pas*ture did make great Politi-\
cians, as well as fat Calves. He pities the little\
knowledge of Truth which thos*e have, that\
have not s*een the World abroad, forgetting,\
that at the s*ame time he tells us, how little\
Credit is to be given to his own Relations and\
thos*e of others, that s*peak and write of their\
Travels. He has worn his own Language to\
Rags, and patched it up with Scraps and Ends\
of foreign--This s*erves him for Wit, and they ap-\
plaud one another accordingly. He believes\
this Raggednes*s of his Dis*cours*e a great Demon-\
s*tration of the Improvement of his Knowledge ;\
as (i) Inns-of-Court (i) Men intimate their Proficiency\
in the Law by the Tatters of their Gowns-\
All the Wit he brought Home with him is like\
foreign Coin, of a bas*er Alloy than our own,\
and s*o will not pas*s here without great Los*s.\

one Country, degenerate by being trans*planted;\
and thos*e of mean Value only improve--If it\
hold with Men, he falls among the Number\
of the latter, and his Improvements are little\
to his Credit. All he can s*ay for hims*elf is,\
his Mind was s*ick of a Cons*umption, and\
change of Air has cured him : For all his other\
Improvements have only been to eat in . . . .\
and talk with thos*e he did not unders*tand; to\
hold Intelligence with all Gazettes, and from\
the Sight of States*men in the Street unriddle\
the Intrigues of all their Councils, to make a\
wondrous Progres*s into Knowledge by riding\
with a Mes*s*enger, and advance In Politics by\
mounting of a Mule, run through all Sorts of\
Learning in a Waggon, and found all Depths\
of Arts in Felucca, ride pos*t into the Secrets\
of all States, and grow acquainted with their\
clos*e Des*igns in Inns and Hos*tleries; for cer-\
tainly there is great Virtue in Highways and\
Hedges to make an able Man, and a good\
Pros*pect cannot but let him s*ee far into Things.\
