[I]s one that takes the s*ame Cours*e,  that the\
[I](i)Devil (i) did in Paradis*e, he begins with the\
Woman. He Des*pis*es all other (i)Fanatics (i) as Up-\
s*tarts, and values hims*elf upon his Antiquity.\
He is a Man-Midwife to the Soul, and is all\
his Life-time in this World deluding it to the\
next. (i) Christ (i) made St. (i) Peter (i) a Fis*her of Men ;\
but he believe it better to be a Fis*her of Wo-\
men, and s*o becomes a Woman's Apos*tle.\
His Profes*s*ion is to dis*guise hims*elf, which he\
does in Sheeps-Cloathing, that is, a Lay Habit ;\
but whether, as a Wolf, a Thief or a Shep-\
herd, is a great Question ; only this is certain,\
that he had rather have one Sheep out of ano-\
ther Man's Fold, that two out of his own.\
He gathers his Church as (i) Fantaics do, yet des*-\
pis*es them for it, and keeps his Flock always in\
Hurdles, to be removed at his Pleas*ure ; and\
though their Souls be rotten or s*cabby with\

Hypocris*y, the Fleece is s*ure to be s*ound and\
orthodox. He tars their Cons*ciences with\
Confes*s*ion and Penance, but always keeps the\
Wool, that he pulls from the Sore, to hims*elf.\
He never makes a Pos*clyte, but he (i) converts (i)\
him to his very Shirt, and (i) turns (i) his Pockets\
into the Bargain ; for he does nothing unles*s\
his Purs*e prove a good (i) Catholic. (i) He never gets\
within a Family, but he gets on the Top of it,\
and governs all down to the Bottom of the\
Cellar--He will not tolerate the Scullion un-\
les*s he be othrodox, nor allow of the turning\
of the Spit, but (i) in ordine ad Spiritualia. (i) His\
(i) Dominion is not founded in Grace, (i) but Sin ; for he\
keeps his Subjects in perfect Awe by being\
acquainted with their mos*t s*acred Iniquities,\
as (i) Juvenal (i) s*aid of the (i) Greeks. (i)\

\
By this means he holds Intelligence with their\
own Cons*ciences agains*t thems*elves, and keeps\
their very Thoughts in Slavery ; for Men com-\
monly fear thos*e that know any Evil of them,\
and out of Shame give Way to them. He is\
very cautious in venturing to attack any Man\
by Way of Convers*ion, whos*e Weaknes*s he is\
not very well acquainted with ; and like the\

Fox, weighs his Goos*e, before he will venture\
to carry him over a River. He fights with the\
(i) Devil (i) at his own Weapons, and s*trives to get\
ground on him with Frauds and Lies--Thes*e\
he convers to pious Us*es. He makes his\
Prayers (the proper Bus*ines*s of the Mind) a\
Kind of Manufacture, and vents them by Tale,\
rather than Weight ; and, while he is bus*ied\
in numbering them, forgets their Sens*e and\
Meaning. He s*ets them up as Men do their\
Games at (i) Picquet, (i) for fear he s*hould be mis*-\
reckoned; but never minds whether he plays\
fair or not. He s*ells Indulgences, like (i) Lockier's (i)\
Pills, with Directions how they are to be taken.\
He is but a Copyholder of the (i) Catholic (i) Church,\
that claims by Cus*tom. He believes the (i) Pope's (i)\
Chain is fas*tened to the Gates of Heaven, like\
King (i) Harry's (i) in the Privy-Gallery./
