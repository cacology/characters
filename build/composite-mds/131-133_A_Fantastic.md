Center FANTASTIC

[Double line capital]Is one that wears his Feather on the Ins*ide\
of his Head. His Brain is like Quicks*ilver,\
apt to receive any Impres*s*ion, but retain none.\
His Mind is made of changeable Stuff, that\
alters Colour with every Motion towards the\
Light. He is a Cormorant, that has but one\
Gut, devours every Thing greedily, but it runs\
through him immediately. He does not know\
s*o much as what he would be, and yet would\
be every Thing he knows. He is like a Paper-\
Lanthorn, that turns with the Smoak of a\
Candle. He wears his Cloaths, as the antient\
Laws of the Land have provided, according\
to his Quality, that he may be known what\
he is by them; and it is as eas*y to decipher\
him by his Habit as a [i] Pudding. He is rigg'd\
with Ribbon, and his Garniture is his Tackle;\

all the res*t of him is Hull. He is s*ure to be\
the earlies*t in the Fas*hion, as others are of\
a Faction, and glories as much to be in the\
Head of a Mode, as a Solider does to be in\
the Head of an Army.  He is admirably s*kil-\
ful in the Mathematics of Cloaths; and can\
tell, at the firs*t View, whether they have the\
right Symmetry. He alters his Gate with the\
Times, and has not a Motion of his Body, that\
(like a Dottrel) he does not borrow from s*ome-\
body els*e. He exercis*es his Limbs, like the\
Pike and Mus*ket, and all his Pos*tures are prac-\
tis*ed--Take him all together, and he is nothing\
but a Trans*lation, Word for Word, out of\
[i] French, [i] an Image cas*t in Plas*ter of [i] Paris, [i] and\
a Puppet s*ent over for others to dres*s thems*elves\
by. He s*peaks [i] French, [i] as Pedants do [i] Latin, [i]\
to s*hew his Breeding; and mos*t naturally,\
where he is leas*t unders*tood. All his non-Na_\
turals, on which his Health and Dis*eases de-\
pend, are [i] s*tile novo. French [i] is his Holiday-Lan-\
guage, that he wears for his Pleas*ure and Or-\
nament, and us*es [i] English [i] only for his Bus*ines*s\
and neces*s*ary Occas*ions. He is like a [i] Scotch-\
man, [i] though he is born a Subject of his own\

#indent He is never quiet, but s*its as the Wind is\
s*aid to do, when it is mos*t in Motion. His\
Head is as full of Maggots as a Pas*toral Poet's\
Flock.  He was begotten, like one of Pliny's\
Portugues*e Hors*es, by the Wind--The Truth\
is he ought not to have been reared; for being\
calved in the Increas*e of the Moon, he Head\
