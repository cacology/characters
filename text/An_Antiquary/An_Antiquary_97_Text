but a Novelty. When he happens to cure a/
s*mall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud/

and could cure all the Dis*eases of Mankind./

World, like thos*e that reckon their Pounds/

are made up. He es*teems no Cus*toms but s*uch/
as have outlived thems*elves, and are long s*ince/
out of Us*e; as the [i] Catholics [i] allow of no Saints,/
but s*uch as are dead, and the [i] Fanatics, [i] in Op-/
pos*ition, of none but the Living./
