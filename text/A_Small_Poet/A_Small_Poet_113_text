      A SMALL POET.         113
titude of s*mall Poets in cons*tant Employment.
He has found out a new Sort of poetical [i]Geor-
gics, [i] a Trick of s*owing Wit like clover-gras*s
on barren Subjec_ts, which would yield nothing
before. This is very us*eful for the Times,
wherein, s*ome men s*ay, there is no Room left
for new Invention.  He will take three Grains
of Wit like the Elixir, and projec_ting it upon
the [i] Iron-Age [i] turns it immediately into [i] Gold--[i]
All the Bus*iness of Mankind has pres*ently
vanis*hed, the whole World has kept Holiday;
there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdes*s*es;
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed
Plum-Porrige.

    We read that [i] Virgil [i] us*ed to make fifty or
    s*ixty Vers*es in a Morning, and afterwards re-
    duce them to ten. This was an unthrifty
    Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the
    Hus*bandry of his own Poetry, as [i] Seneca [i] s*ays
    he was in that of a Farm; for in plain [i] Englis*h[i]

      [i] As Seneca s*ays he was in that of a farm.] Seneca [i] in his 86th
      Epis*tle finds s*everal Faults wich [i] Virgil's [i] Rules and Obs*ervations in
      Hus*bandry, as they are delivered in his [i] Georgics, and adds of him--
      "Qui nos quod veris*s*ime, s*ed quid decentis*s*ime diceretur, as-
      " s*pexit; nec Agricolas docere voluit, s*ed legentes delec_tore".
