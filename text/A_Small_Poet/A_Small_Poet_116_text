116      A SMALL POET.

fore he has no Res*pec_t to Decorum and Pro-
priety of Circums*tance; for the Regard of
Pers*ons, Times, and Places is a Res*traint too
s*ervile to e impos*ed upon poetical Licence;
like him that made [i] Plato[i] confes*s [i] Juvenal [i] to be
a Philos*opher, or [i] Pers*ius, that calls teh [i] Athe-
nians Quirites [i].

  For [i] Metaphors, [i] he us*es to chus*e the hardes*t,
and mos*t far-fet that he can light upon--Thes*e
are the Jewels of Eloquence, and therefore the
harder they are, the more precious they mus*t
be.

  He'll take s*cant Piece of coars*e Sens*e, and
s*tretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a s*core
Rhimes, utnil it crack that you may s*ee through
it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head. When
you s*ee his Vers*es hanged up in Tobacco-Shops,
you may s*ay, in defiance of the Proverb, [i] that
the weakes*t does not always go to the Wall; [i] for 'tis

    [i] Like him that made Plaot, &c.] [i] Who this Blunder is to be fa-
thered upon I cannot dis*cover; but that which he imports to [i] Per-
s*ius, [i] and another of Juvenal's Pas*s*age of his own in a Part of his
Pros*e Collec_tions called [i]Criticis*ms upon Books and Autohrs, [i] will ex-
plain--[i] Persius, [i] s*ays, he commits a very great Abs*urdity, when
laying the Scene of his fourth Satyr in [i] Greece [i], and bringing in [i] So-
crates reproving a young statesmen, he makes him call the [i] Gre-
cians  [i] Quirites.
