   A SMALL POET.  127/
in the whole World have been glad to derive/
their Pedigrees, and their Power too, from/
Poets.  [i] Alexander [i] the great had no wis*er a Way/
so s*ecure the Empire to hims*elf by [i] Right, [i]/
which he had gotten by [i] Force, [i] then by de-/
claring hims*elf the Son of [i] Jupiter; [i] and who/
was [i] Jupiter [i] but the Son of a Poet? So [i] Caes*ar [i]/
and all [i] Rome [i] was transported with Joy, when a/
Poet made [i] Jupiter [i] his Colleague in the Empire;/
and when [i] Jupiter [i] governed, what did the/
Poets, that governed Jupiter?/
