136 #Center A MELANCHOLY MAN./
makes him believe, that it is s*omething els*e/
than it is, and that he holds Intelligence with/
Spirits, that reveal whats*oever he fancies to/
him, as the antient rude People, that firs*t heard/
their own Voices repeated by Echoes in the/
Woods, concluded it mus*t proceed from s*ome/
invisible Inhabitants of thos*e s*olitary Places,/
which they after believed to be Gods, and/
called them [i] Sylvans, Fauns, [i] and [i] Dryads. [i] He/
makes the Infirmity of his Temper pas*s for/
Revelations, as [i] Mahomet [i] did by his falling/
Sicknes*s, and ins*pires hims*elf with the Wind/
of his own Hypocondries. He laments, like/
[i] Heraclitus [i] the Maudlin Philos*opher, at other/
Men's Mirth, and take Pleas*ures in nothing/
but his own un-s*ober Sadnes*s. His Mind is/
full of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like/
a Nes*t of Boxes. He s*leeps little, but dreams/
much, and s*oundes*t when he is waking. He/
s*ees Vis*ions further off than a s*econd-s*ighted/
Man in [i] Scotland, [i] and dreams upon a hard/
Point with admirable Judgement. He is jus*t/
s*o much wors*e than a Madman, as he is below/
him in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen/
the mos*t mad govern all the res*t, and receive/
a natural Obedience from their Inferiors./
