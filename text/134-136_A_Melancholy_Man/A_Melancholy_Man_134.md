# A\
MELANCHOLY MAN

I^2^s one, that keeps the worſt Company in the\
World, that is, his own; and tho' he be al-\
ways falling out and quarrelling with himſelf,\
yet he has not power to endure any other Con-\
verſation. His Head is haunted, like a Houſe,\
with evil Spirits and Apparitions, that terrify\
and fright him out of himſelf, till he ſtands\
empty and forſaken. His Sleeps and his Wa-\
kings are ſo much the ſame, that he knows not\
how to diſtinguiſh them, and many times\
when he dreams, he believes he is broad awake\
and ſees Viſions. The Fumes and Vapours\
that riſe from his Spleen and Hypocondries\
have ſo ſmutched and ſullied his Brain (like a\
Room that ſmoaks) that his Underſtanding is\
blear-ey'd, and has no right Perception of any\
Thing. His Soul lives in his Body, like a\
Mole in the Earth, that labours in the Dark,\
and caſts up Doubts and Scruples of his own
