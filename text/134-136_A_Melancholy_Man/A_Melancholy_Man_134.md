Center MELANCHOLY MAN\

#[double line initial cap]Is one, that keeps the wors*t Company in the\
World, that is, his own; and tho' he be al-\
ways falling out and quarrelling with hims*elf,\
yet he has not power to endure any other Con-\
vers*ation. His Head is haunted, like a Hous*e,\
with evil Spirits and Apparitions, that terrify\
and fright him out of hims*elf, till he s*tands\
empty and fors*aken. His Sleeps and his Wa-\
kings are s*o much the s*ame, that he knows not\
how to dis*tinguis*h them, and many times\
when he dreams, he believes he is broad awake\
and s*ees Vis*ions. The Fumes and Vapours\
that ris*e from his Spleen and Hypocondries\
have s*o s*mutched and s*ullied his Brain (like a\
Room that s*moaks) that his Unders*tanding is\
blear-ey'd, and has no right Perception of any\
Thing. His Soul lives in his Body, like a\
Mole in the Earth, that labours in the Dark,\
and cas*ts up Doubts and Scruples of his own\
