makes him believe, that it is ſomething elſe\
than it is, and that he holds Intelligence with\
Spirits, that reveal whatſoever he fancies to\
him, as the antient rude People, that firſt heard\
their own Voices repeated by Echoes in the\
Woods, concluded it muſt proceed from ſome\
invisible Inhabitants of thoſe ſolitary Places,\
which they after believed to be Gods, and\
called them *Sylvans, Fauns,* and *Dryads.* He\
makes the Infirmity of his Temper paſs for\
Revelations, as *Mahomet* did by his falling\
Sickneſs, and inſpires himſelf with the Wind\
of his own Hypocondries. He laments, like\
*Heraclitus* the Maudlin Philoſopher, at other\
Men's Mirth, and take Pleaſures in nothing\
but his own un-ſober Sadneſs. His Mind is\
full of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like\
a Neſt of Boxes. He ſleeps little, but dreams\
much, and ſoundeſt when he is waking. He\
ſees Viſions further off than a ſecond-ſighted\
Man in *Scotland,* and dreams upon a hard\
Point with admirable Judgement. He is juſt\
ſo much worſe than a Madman, as he is below\
him in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen\
the moſt mad govern all the reſt, and receive\
a natural Obedience from their Inferiors.
