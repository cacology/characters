LOVER

Is a Kind of Goth and Vandal, that leaves
his native self to settle in another, or a
Planter that forsakes his Country, where he
was born, to labour and dig in Virginia.
His Heart is catched in a Net with a Pair of
bringht shining Eyes, as Larks are with Pieces
of a looking-Glass.  He makes heavy Complaints against it for deserting of him, and
desires to have another in Exchange for it,
which is a very unreasonable Request ; for if
it betrayed its bosom Friend, what will it do
to a stranger, that should give it Trust and
Entertainment ?  He binds himself, and cries
out he is robbed of his Heart, and charges the
Innocent with it, only to get a good Composition, or another for it, against Conscience and Honesty.  He talks much of his
Flame, and pretends to be burnt by his Mistress’s Eyes, for which he requires satisfaction
from her, like one that sets his House on Fire
to get a Brief for charitable Contributions.
He makes his Mistress all of stars, and when
she is unkind, rails at them, as if they did ill
Offices between them, and being of her Kin
set her against him.  He falls in Love as Men
fall sick when their Bodies are inclined to it,
and imputes that to his Mistresses Charms,
which is really in his own Temper ; for when
that is altered, the other vanishes of it self, and
therefore one said not amiss,

The Lilly and the Rose
Not in her Cheeks, but in thy Temper grows.

When his Desires are grown up, they swarm,
and fly out to seek a new Habitation, and
wheresoever they light they fix like Bees, among
which some late Philosophers have observed
that it is a Female that leads all the rest.  Love
is but a Clap of the Mind, a Kind of running of the Fancy, that breaks out, if it be
not stopped in Time, into Botches of heroic
Rime ; for all Lovers are poets for the Time
being, and make their Ladies a Kind of mosaic Work of several coloured stones joined
together by a strong Fancy, but very stiff and
unnatural ; and though they steal stars from
Heaven, as Prometheus did Fire, to animate
them, all will not make them alive, nor
alives-liking.
