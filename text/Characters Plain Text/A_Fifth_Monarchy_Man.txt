A 
FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN

Is one, that is not contented to be a Privy
Counsellor of the Kingdom of Heaven, but 
would fain be a Minister of state of this World, 
and translate the Kingdom of Heaven to the 
Kingdom of Earth.  His Design is to make 
*Christ* King, as his Forefathers the *Jew* did, 
only to abuse and crucify him, that he might 
share his Lands and Goods, as he did his Vicegerents here.  He dreams of a Fool's Paradise 
without a serpent in it, a golden Age all of 
saints, and no Hypocrites, all *holy-Court* Princes, 
and no subjects but the Wicked;  a Government of *Perkin Warbec* and *Lambert simnel* 
saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it, 
might make himself a Price, and claim a 
Title to the Crown.  He fancies a *fifth-Monarchy* as the Quintessence of all Governments, 
abstracted from all Matter, and consisting 
wholly of Revelations, Visions, and Mysteries. 
*John* of *Leyden* was the first Founder of it, and 
though he miscarried, like *Romulus* in a Tempest, his Posterity have Revelations every full 
Moon, that there may be a Time to set up his 
Title again, and with better success ; though 
his Brethren, that have attempted to since, had 
no sooner quartered his Coat with their own, 
but their whole outward Men were set on the 
Gates of the City ; where a Head and four 
Quarters stand as Types and Figures of the 
*fifth-Monarchy.* They have been contriving since 
Experiments, that cost Necks are too chargeable to try it in little, and have deposed King 
*Oberon,* to erect their Monarchy in *Fairy-Land, 
as being the most proper and natural Region in 
the whole World for their Government, and if 
it succeed there to proceed further.  The Devil's Prospect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth, 
and the Glory of them, has so dazzled their Eyes, 
that they would venture their Necks to take 
him at his Word, and give him his Price. 
Nothing comes so near the Kingdom of Darkness as the *fifth-Monarchy,* that is no where to 
be found, but in dark Prophesies, obscure Mythologies, and mystical Riddles, like the Visions *Aeneas* saw in Hell of the *Roman* Empire. 
Next this it most resembles *Mahomet*’s Coming 
to the *Turks,* and King *Arthur*’s Reign over the 
Britons in *Merlin*’s Prophesies ; so near of Kin 
are all fantastic Illusions, that you may discern 
the same Lineaments in them all.  The poor 
Wicked are like to have a very ill time under 
them, for they are resolved upon arbitrary Government, according to their ancient and fundamental Revelations, and to have no subjects 
but slaves, who between them and the *Devil* 
are like to suffer Persecution enough to make 
them as able saints, as their Lords and Masters.  He gathers Churches on the sunday, as 
the *Jews* did sticks on their sabbath, to set the 
state on Fire.  He humms and hahs high Trea
son, and calls upon it, as Gamesters do on the 
Cast they would throw.  He groans sedition, 
and, like the *Pharisee,* rails, when he gives 
Thanks.  He interprets Prophesies, as *Whittington* did the Bells, to speak to him, and governs 
himself accordingly.
