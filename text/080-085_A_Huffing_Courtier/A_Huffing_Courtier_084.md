pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as\
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit.  His Legs are\
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like\
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant\
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not\
cloathed, but packt up.  His Hat has been long\
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now\
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover\
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of\
Garlick.  He wears Garniture on the Toes of\
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,\
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being\
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt.  When he\
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-\
men do their Vizard-Maſques.  His Ribbons\
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a\
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,\
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-\
rows from Reflection.  He is as tender of his\
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as\
loth to have them diſordered.  His Bravery\
is all his Happineſs ; and like *Atlas* he carries\
his Heaven on his Back.  He is like the golden\
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back.  He\
is a Monſter or an *Indian* Creature, that is\
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.\
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle\
