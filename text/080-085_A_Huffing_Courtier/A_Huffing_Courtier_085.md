in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-\
dies to play upon, who when they have done\
with him, let down his treble-String, till they\
are in the Humour again.  His Cook and Va-\
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and\
him ſo punctually together, that the one may\
not be ready before the other.  As Peacocks and\
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,\
yet cannot fly ;  ſo all his Bravery is to flutter\
only.  The Beggars call him *my Lord,* and he\
takes them at their Words, and pays them for\
it.  If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-\
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make\
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-\
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him\
when you have him.\
