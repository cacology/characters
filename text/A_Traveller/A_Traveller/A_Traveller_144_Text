[I]s a Native of all Countries, and an Alien at/
[I]Home.  He flies from the Place where he/
was hatched, like a Wildgoos*e, and prefers all/
others before it.  He has no Quarrel to it, but/
becaus*e he was born in it, and like a Bas*tard,/
he is as*hamed of his Mother, becaus*e s*he is of/
him. He is a Merchant, that makes Voyages/
into foreign Nations, to drive a Trade in Wis*-/
dom and Politics, and is is not for his Credit/
to have it thoughts, he has made an ill Return,/
which mus*t be, if he s*hould allow of any of/
the Growth of his own Country.  This makes/
him quick and blow up hims*elf with Admira-/
tion of foreign Parts, and a generous Con-/
tempt of Home, that all Men may admire, at/
leas*t, the means he has had of Improvement,/
and deplore their own Defects*. His Obs*erva-/
tions are like a Sieve, that lets the finer Flour/
pas*s, and retains only the Bran of Things;/
