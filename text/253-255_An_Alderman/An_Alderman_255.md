ing, and, like a Cock, ſcrapes when he feeds ;\
for the Public pays for all and more, which he\
and his Brethren ſhare among themſelves ;  for\
they never make a dry Reckoning.  When he\
comes to be Lord-Mayor he does not keep a\
great Houſe, but a very great Houſe-warming\
for a whole Year ; for though he invites all the\
*Companies* in the City he does not treat them,\
but they club to entertain him, and pay the\
Reckoning beforehand.  His Fur-gown makes\
him look a great deal bigger than he is, like\
the Feathers of an Owl, and when he pulls\
it off, he looks as if he were fallen away, or\
like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.\
