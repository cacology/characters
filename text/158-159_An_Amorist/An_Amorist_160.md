mounted in a Coach as a Convoy, to guard the\
Ladies, to take the Duſt in *Hyde-Park*; where\
by his prudent Management of the Glaſs Win-\
dows he ſecures them from Beggars, and re-\
turns fraught with China-Oranges and Ballads.\
Thus he is but a Gentleman-Uſher General,\
and his Buſineſs is to carry one Lady's Services\
to another, and bring back the others in Ex-\
change.\
