#AN\
AMORIST

I^2^s an Artificer, or Maker of Love, a ſworn\
Servant to all Ladies, like an Officer in a\
Corporation. Though no one in particular\
will own any Title to him, yet he never fails,\
upon all Occaſions, to offer his Services, and\
they as ſeldom to turnn it back again untouched.\
He commits nothing with them, but himſelf to\
their good Graces ; and they recommend him\
back again to his own, where he finds ſo kind\
a Reception, that he wonders how he does\
fail of it every where elſe.  His Paſſion is as\
eaſily ſet on Fire as a Fart, and as ſoon out\
again. He is charged an primed with Love-\
Powder like a Gun, and the leaſt Sparkle of an\
Eye gives Fire to him, and off he goes, but\
ſeldom, or never, hits the Mark.  He has com-\
mon Places and Precedents of Repartees and\
Letters for all Occaſions ; and falls as readily\
into his Method of making love, as a Parſon\
