BANKRUPT

I^2^S made by breaking, as a Bird is hatched\
by breaking the Shell, for he gains more\
by giving over his Trade, than ever he did by\
dealing in it.  He drives a Trade, as *Oliver*\
*Cromwel* did a Coach, till it broke in Pieces.\
He is very tender and careful in preſerving\
his Credit, and keeps it as methodically as a\
Race-nag is dieted, that in the End he may\
run away with it: for he observes a punctual\
Curioſity in performing his Word, until he\
has improved his Credit as far as it can go ;\
and then he has catched the Fiſh, and throws\
away the Net ; as a Butcher, when he has fed\
his Beaſt as fat as it can grow, cuts the Throat\
