Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form\
of juſt Wit, are above his Philoſophy.  He\
appears ſo over concerned in all Men’s Wits,\
as if they were but Diſparagements of his\
own ; and crys down all they do, as if they\
were Encroachments upon him.  He takes\
Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them, as\
*Justices* do falſe Weights, and Pots that want\
Meaſure.  When he meets with any Thing,\
that is very good, he changes it into ſmall\
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to\
ſerve ſeveral Occaſions.  He diſclaims Study,\
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to ſhoot\
flying, which appears to be very true by his\
often miſſing of his Mark.  His Wit is much\
troubled with Obſtructions ;  and he has Fits as\
painful as thoſe of the Spleen.   He fancies him-\
ſelf a dainty ſpruce Shepherd, with a Flock and\
a fine ſilken Shepherdeſs, that follows his Pipe,\
as Rats did the Conjurers in *Germany*.

   As for *Epithets*, he always avoids thoſe, that\
are near akin to the Senſse.  Such matches are\
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a *Chriſtian*\
Poet ; and therefore all his Care is to chuſe out\
