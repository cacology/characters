He has found out a new Sort of poetical *Geor-*\
*gics*, a Trick of ſowing Wit like clover-graſs\
on barren Subjects, which would yield nothing\

there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,\
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdeſſes ;\

Plum-Porrige.

   We read that *Virgil* uſed to make[^3] fifty or\

“ Qui non quod veriſſime, ſed quid decentiſſime diceretur, ad-\
“ ſpexit ; nec Agricolas docere voluit, ſed legentes delectare.”
