in the whole World have been glad to derive/
their Pedigrees, and their Power too, from/
Poets.  * Alexander * the great had no wiſer a Way/
so ſecure the Empire to himſelf by * Right, */
which he had gotten by * Force, * then by de-/
claring himſelf the Son of * Jupiter; * and who/
was * Jupiter * but the Son of a Poet? So * Caeſar */
and all * Rome * was transported with Joy, when a/
Poet made * Jupiter * his Colleague in the Empire;/
and when * Jupiter * governed, what did the/
Poets, that governed Jupiter?
