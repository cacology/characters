fore he has no Reſpect to Decorum and Pro-\
priety of Circumſtance ; for the Regard of\

Proſe Collections called *Criticiſms upon Books and Autohrs*, will ex-\

laying the Scene of his fourth Satyr in *Greece*, and bringing in *So*-\
*crates* reproving a young Stateſmen, he makes him call the *Græ*-\
*cians* Quirites. [*footnote cont. next page*][^8]
