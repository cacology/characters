ſliding down *Parnaſſus*.  Whatſoever he hears\
well ſaid[^1] he ſeizes upon by poetical Licence ;\
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill\
repeating of it---This he believes to be no\
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others\
throw away.  By this means his Writings are,\
like a Taylor’s Cuſhion, of moſaic Work,\
made up of ſeveral Scraps ſewed together.\
He calls a ſlovenly naſty Deſcription *great Na-*\
*ture*, and dull Flatneſs *strange Eaſineſs*.  He\
writes down all that comes in his Head, and\
makes no Choice, becauſe he has nothing to\
do it with, that is Judgment.  He is always\
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like\
the *long Parliament* making *Ordinances* in their\
Stead ; although they are perpetually *thrown*\
*out* of Coffee-Houſes, and come to Nothing.\
He is like an *Italian* Thief, that never robs,\
but he murthers, to prevent Diſcovery ; ſo ſure\
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-\
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may paſs\
unſuſpected.  He is but a Copier at beſt, and\
will never arrive to practice by the Life : For\
bar him the Imitation of ſomething he has\
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.
