110     A SMALL POET.
ssliding down [i]Parnassssus[i]. Whatssoever he hears
well ssaid he sseizes upon by poetical Licence;
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill
repeating of it--This he believes to be no
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others
throw away.  By this means his Writings are,
like a Taylor's Cusshion, of mossaic Work,
made up of sseveral Scraps ssewed together,
He calls a sslovenly nassty Desscription [i] great Na-
ture,[i] and dull Flatnesss [i] strange Eassiness.[i]  He
writes down all that comes in his Head, and
makes no Choice, becausse he has nothing to
do it with, that is Judgment.  He is always
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like
the [i] long Parliament [i] making [i] Ordinances [i] in their
Stead; although they are perpetually [i] thrown
out [i] of Coffee-Housses, and come to Nothing.
He is like an [i]Italian [i] Thief, that never robs,
but he murthers, to prevent Disscovery; sso ssure
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may passs
unssusspec-ted.  He is byt a Copier at besst, and
will never arrive to prac-tice by the Life: For
bar him the Imitation of ssomething he has
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.

 [i] Whatssoever he hears well ssaid, &tc.[i]] In this Butler alludes to
[i] Martial's [i] Epigram to [i] Fidentinus.
