           A SMALL POET.                 111
Obs*ervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form
of jus*t Wit, are above his Philos*ophy.  He
appears s*o over concerned in all Men's Wits,
as if they were but Dis*paragements of his
own; and crys down all they do, as if they
were Encroachments upon him. He takes
Jes*ts fromt he Owners and breaks them, as
[i] Justices[i] do fals*e Weights, and Pots that want
Meas*ure.  When he meets with any Thing,
that is very good, he change it into s*mall
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to
s*erve s*everal Occas*ions.  He dis*claims Study,
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to s*hoot
flying, which appears to be very true by his
often mis*s*ing of his Mark.  His Wit is much
troubled with Obs*truc_tions;  and he has Fits as
painful as thos*e of the Spleen.   He fancies him-
s*elf a dainty s*pruce Shepherd, with a Flock and
a fine s*ilken Shepherds*s, that follows his Pipe,
as Rats did the Conjurers in [i] Germany.[i]

As for [i] Epithets, [i] he always avoids those, that
are near akin to the Sens*se.  Such matches are
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a [i] Chris*tian[i]
Poet; and therefore all his Care is to chus*e out

[i]Quem recitas meus est, O Fidentinus, libellus:
sed male cum recitas, incipit es*s*e tuus. Mare. L. 1. Ep 39 [i]
