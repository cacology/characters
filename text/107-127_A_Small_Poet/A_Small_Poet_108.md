know his Wit not to be natural, ’tis ſo un-\
quiet and troubleſome in him : For as thoſe,\
that have Money but ſeldom, are always ſhak-\
ing their Pockets, when they have it ; ſo does\
he, when he thinks he has got ſomething, that\
will make him appear.  He is a perpetual Tal-\
ker ; and you may know by the Freedom of his\
Diſcourſe, that he came light by it, as Thieves\
ſpend freely what they get.  He meaſures other\
Men’s Wits by *their* Modeſty, and his own by\
*his* Confidence.  He makes nothing of writing\
Plays, becauſe he has not Wit enough to un-\
derstand the Difficulty.  This makes him ven-\
ture to talk and ſcribble, as Chowſes do to play\
with cunning Gameſters, until they are cheated\
and laughed at.  He is always talking of Wit,\
as thoſe, that have bad Voices, are always ſing-\
ing out of Tune ; and thoſe, that cannot play,\
delight to fumble on Inſtruments.  He grows\
the unwiſer by other Men’s Harms ; for the\
worſe others write, he finds the more Encou-\
ragement to do ſo too.  His Greedineſs of\
Praiſe is ſo eager, that he ſwallows any Thing,\
that comes in the Likeneſs of it, how notorious\
and palpable ſoever, and is as Shot-free againſt\
any Thing, that may leſſen his good Opinion\
