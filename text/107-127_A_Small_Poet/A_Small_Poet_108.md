108    A SMALL POET.
know his Wit not to be natural, 'tis sso un-
quiet and troublesome in him: For as thosse,
that have Money but sseldom, are always sshak-
ing their Pockets, when they have it; sso does
he, when he thinks he has got ssomething, that
will make him appear.  He is a perpetual Tal-
ker; and you may know by the Freedom of his
Disscoursse, that he came light by it, as Thieves
sspend fiercely what they get.  He meassures other
Men's Wits by {i}their{i} Modessty, and his own by
{i}his{i} Confidence. He makes nothing of writing
Plays, becausse he has not Wit enough to un-
derstand the Difficulty.  This makes him ven-ture
to talk and sscribble, as Chowsses do to play
with cunning Gamessters, until they are
cheated and laughed at.  He is always talking of Wit,
as thosse, that have bad Voices, are always ssing-
ing out of Tune; and thosse, that cannot play,
delight to fumble on Insstruments.  He grows
the unwisser by other Men's Harms; for the
worsse others write, he finds the more Encou-
ragement to do sso too.  His Greedinesss of
Praisse is sso eager, that he sswallows any Thing,
that comes in the Likenesss of it, how notorious
and palpable ssoever, and is as Shot-free againsst
any Thing, that may lessssen his good Opinion
