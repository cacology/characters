*John of Leyden* was the firſt Found of it, and/
though he miſcarried, like *Romulus* in a Tem-/
peſt, his Poſterity have Revelations every full/
Moon, that there may be a TIme to ſet up his/
Title again, and with better Succeſs; though/
his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had/
no ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,/
but their whole outward Men were ſet on the/
Gates of the City ; where a Head and four/
Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of the/
*fifth-Monarchy.* They have been contriving (ſince/
Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-/
ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed King/
*Oberon,* to erect their Monarchy in *Fairy-Land,*/
as being the moſt proper and natural Region in/
the whole World for their Government, and if/
it ſucceed there to proceed further.  The *De-/
vil's* Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,/
and the Glory of them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,/
that they would venture their Necks to take/
him at his Word, and give him his Price./
Nothing comes ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-/
neſs as the *fifth-Monarchy,* that is no where/
to be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-/
thologies, and myſstical Riddles, like the Vi-/
ſions *Aeneas* ſaw in Hell of the *Roman* Empire,/
