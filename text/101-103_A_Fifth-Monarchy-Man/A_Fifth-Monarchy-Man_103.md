Next this is the moſt reſembles *Mahomet's* Coming/
to the *Turks,* and King *Arthur's* Reign over the/
Britons in *Merlin*'s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin/
are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern/
the ſame Lineaments in them all. The poor/
Wicked are like to have a very ill time under/
them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-/
vernment, according to their ancient and fun-/
damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects/
but Slaves, who between them and the *Devil*/
are like to ſuffer Perſecution enough to make/
them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-/
ters.  He gather Churches on the Sunday, as/
the *Jew* did Sitkcs on their Sabbath, to ſet the/
State on Fire.  He humms and hahs high Trea-/
ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the/
Caſt they would throw.  He groans Sedition,/
and, like the *Phariſee,* rails, when he gives/
Thanks.  He interprets Propheſies, as *Whitting-/
ton* did the Bells, to ſpeak to him, and governs/
himſelf accordingly./
