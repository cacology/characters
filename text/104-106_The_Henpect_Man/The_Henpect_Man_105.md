Wit he has being held *in capite* has rendered all\
the reſt of his Concerments liable to Pupi-\
lage and Wardſhip, and his Wife has the\
Tuition of his during his or her Life ; and\
he has no Power to do any Thing of himſelf,\
but by his Guardian.  His Wife manages him\
and his Eſtate with equal Authority, and he\
lives unde rher aribtrary Government and Com-\
mand as his ſuperior Office.  He is but a kind\
of Meſſuage and Tenement in the Occupation\
of his Wife.  He and ſhe make up a Kind of\
Hermaphrodite, a Monſter, or which the one\
half is more than the whole ; for he is the\
weaker Veſſel, and but his Wife's Helper.  His\
Wife eſpouſed and took him to Huſband for\
better or worſe, and the laſt Word ſtands.\
He was meant to be his Wife's Head, but being\
ſet on at the wrong End ſhe makes him ſerve\
(like the Jeſuits Devil) for her Feet.  He is her\
Province, an Acquiſition that ſhe took in,\
and gives Laws to at Indiſcretion ; for being\
overmatched and too feeble for the Encounter,\
he was forced to ſubmit and take Quarter.\
He has inverted the Curſe, and turned it upon\
himſelf ; for his Deſire is towards his Wife,\
and ſhe reign over him, and with *Eſau* has\
ſold his Birthright for a Meſs of Matrimony.\
