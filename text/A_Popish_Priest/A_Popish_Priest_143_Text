#Center A POPISH PRIEST. #Left 143/
Fox, weighs his Goos*e, before he will venture/
to carry him over a River. He fights with the/
(i) Devil (i) at his own Weapons, and s*trives to get/
ground on him with Frauds and Lies--Thes*e/
he convers to pious Us*es. He makes his/
Prayers (the proper Bus*ines*s of the Mind) a/
Kind of Manufacture, and vents them by Tale,/
rather than Weight ; and, while he is bus*ied/
in numbering them, forgets their Sens*e and/
Meaning. He s*ets them up as Men do their/
Games at (i) Picquet, (i) for fear he s*hould be mis*-/
reckoned; but never minds whether he plays/
fair or not. He s*ells Indulgences, like (i) Lockier's (i)/
Pills, with Directions how they are to be taken./
He is but a Copyholder of the (i) Catholic (i) Church,/
that claims by Cus*tom. He believes that (i) Pope's (i)/
Chain is fas*tened to the Gates of Heaven, like/
King (i) Harry's (i) in the Privy-Gallery./
