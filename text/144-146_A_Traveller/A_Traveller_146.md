Improvements have only been to eat in . . . .\

hold Intelligence with all Gazettes, and from\
the Sight of States*men in the Street unriddle\
the Intrigues of all their Councils, to make a\
wondrous Progres*s into Knowledge by riding\
with a Mes*s*enger, and advance In Politics by\
mounting of a Mule, run through all Sorts of\
Learning in a Waggon, and found all Depths\
of Arts in  Felucca, ride pos*t into the Secrets\
of all States, and grow acquainted with their\
clos*e Des*igns in Inns and Hos*tleries; for cer-\
tainly there is great Virtue in Highways and\
Hedges to make an able Man, and a good\
Pros*pect cannot but let him s*ee far into Things.\
