#Center THE HENPECT MAN. #justifyleft 105/
Wit he has being held [i] in capite [i] has rendered all/
the res*t of his Concerments liable to Pupi-/
lage and Wards*hip, and his Wife has the/
Tuition of his during his or her Life; and/
he has no Power to do any Thing of hims*elf,/
but by his Guardian. His Wife manages him/
and his Es*tate with equal Authority, and he/
lives unde rher aribtrary Government and Com-/
mand as his s*uperior Office. He is but a kind/
 of Mes*s*uage and Tenement in the Occupation/
 of his Wife. He and s*he make up a Kind of/
 Hermaphrodite, a Mons*ter, or which the one/
 half is more than the whole; for he is the/
 weaker Ves*s*el, and but his Wife's Helper. His/
 Wife es*pous*ed and took him to Hus*band for/
 better or wors*e, and the las*t Word s*tands./
 He was meant to be his Wife's Head, but being/
 s*et on at the wrong End s*he makes him s*erve/
 (like the Jes*uits Devil) for her Feet. He is her/
 Province, an Acquis*ition that s*he took in,/
 and gives Laws to at Indis*cretion; for being/
 overmatched and too feeble for the Encounter,/
 he was forced to s*ubmit and take Quarter./
 He has inverted the Curs*e, ad turned it upon/
 hims*elf; for his Des*ire is towards his Wife,/
 and s*he reign over him and with [i] Es*au [i] has/
 s*old his Birthright for a Mes*s of Matrimony./
