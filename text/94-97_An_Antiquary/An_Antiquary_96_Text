96 #[Center] AN ANTIQUARY./
for Things that are antient, and the further off

/
#He is a great Time-s*erver, but is is of Time/
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,/
but is wholly retied from the pres*ent. His/
Days were s*pent and gone long before he came/
into the World, and s*ince his only Bus*iness is/
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of/
them. He has s*o s*trong a natural Affections to/
any Thing that is old, that he may truly [i] s*ay to/
Dus*t and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-/
tennes*t thou are my Mother. He has no Provi-/
dence nor Fore-s*ight; for all his Contempla-/
tions look backward upon the Days of old,/
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he/
walked backwards. He has rather interpret/
one obs*cure Word in any old s*ens*eles*s Dis*-/
cours*e, than be the Author of the mos*t ingenious/
new one; and with [i] Scaliger [i] would s*ell the/
Empire of [i] Germany [i] (if it were in his Power)/
for an old Song. He devours an old Manus*-/
cript with great Relis*h than Worms and Moths/
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values/
/
 [i] And with [i] Scaliger [i] would s*ell the Empire of Germany[i]] This al-/
 ludes to a ranting Exclamation of [i] Scaliger's upon an Ode in [i] Horace, [i]/
 which he was particularly pleased with./
