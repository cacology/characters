it above any Thing printed, which he accounts\
but a Novelty.  When he happens to cure a\
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud\
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,\
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.\
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-\
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are\
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the\
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds\
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they\
are made up.  He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch\
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince\
out of Uſe ; as the *Catholics* allow of no Saints,\
but ſuch as are dead, and the *Fanatics*, Op-\
poſition, of none but the Living.\
