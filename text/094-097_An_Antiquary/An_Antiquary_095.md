  and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes\
  ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does\
  it, the further they are from being new to him.\
  All his Curiouſities take place of one another\
  according to their Seniority, and he values\
  them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.\
  He has a great Veneration for Words that are\
  ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that\
  they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe\
  he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-\
  tiquity, and the good Services they have done.\
  He throws away his Time in enquiring after\
  that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,\
  like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find\
  out another that was loſt before.  He fetches\
  things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable\
  of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own\
  Aſhes.  He values one old Invention, that is\
  loſt and never to be recovered, before all the\
  new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.\
  The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with\
  his, that ſhows the Tombs at *Westminster*, only\
  the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other\
  for Money.  As every Man has but one Fa-\
  ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World\
  of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value\
