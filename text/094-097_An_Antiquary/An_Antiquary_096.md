for Things that are antient, and the further off\
the greater.

   He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time\
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,\
but is wholly retied from the preſent.  His\
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came\
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is\
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of\
them.  He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to\
any Thing that is old, that he may truly *ſay to*\
*Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-*\
*tenneſs thou are my Mother*.  He has no Provi-\
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-\
tions look backward upon the Days of old,\
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he\
walked backwards.  He had rather interpret\
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-\
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious\
new one ; and with *Scaliger* would ſell the\
Empire of *Germany*[^1] (if it were in his Power)\
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-\
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths\
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values\


[^1]:   *And with* Scaliger *would ſell the Empire of Germany*]  This al-\
ludes to a ranting Exclamation of *Scaliger*’s upon an Ode in *Horace*,\
which he was particularly pleased with.
