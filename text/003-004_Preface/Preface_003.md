#PREFACE.

*T^2^HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit*\
*much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt*\
*Century.  The two principal Authors in this Way*\
*were Sir* Thomas Overbury, *and Dr.* John\
Earle *Tutor to Prince* Charles *in* 1643, *and after*\
*the Reſtoration Dean of* Weſtminſter, *and ſuc-*\
*ceſſively Biſhop of* Worceſter *and* Saliſbury.  *How*\
*agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public*\
*Taſte may be judged from Sir* Thomas’s *little Book*\
*having fourteen Editions before* 1632, *and the*\
*Biſhop’s ſix between* 1628 *and* 1633.  *Whether*\
Butler *has equalled or excelled them, and what*\
*Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt*\
*be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-*\
*reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me*\
*a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge.  The Reader*\
*will have an Opportunity of determining for him-*\
*ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame*\
*Pictures.*\
