#Center FANTASTIC/
[Double line capital]Is one that wears his Feather on the Ins*ide/
of his Head. His Brain is like Quicks*ilver,/
apt to receive any Impres*s*ion, but retain none./
His Mind is made of changeable Stuff, that/
alters Colour with every Motion towards the/
Light. He is a Cormorant, that has but one/
Gut, devours every Thing greedily, but it runs/
through him immediately. He does not know/
s*o much as what he would be, and yet would/
be every Thing he knows. He is like a Paper-/
Lanthorn, that turns with the Smoak of a/
Candle. He wears his Cloaths, as the antient/
Laws of the Land have provided, according/
to his Quality, that he may be known what/
he is by them; and it is as eas*y to decipher/
him by his Habit as a [i] Pudding. He is rigg'd/
with Ribbon, and his Garniture is his Tackle;/
