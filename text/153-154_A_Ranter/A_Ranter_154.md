For as ſtrong Bodies may freely venture to do,/
and ſuffer that, without any Hurt to them-/
ſelves, which would deſtroy thoſe that are/
feeble: So a Saint, that is ſtrong in Grace,/
may boldly engage himſelf in thoſe great Sins/
and Iniquities, that would eaſily damn a weak/
Brother, and yet come off never the worſe./
He believes Deeds of Darkneſs to be only thoſe/
Sins that are committed in private, not thoſe/
that are acted openly and owned.  He is but/
an *Hypocrite* turned the wrong Side outward ;/
for, as the one wears his Vices within, and/
the other without, ſo when they are counter-/
changed the *Ranter* becomes an *Hypocrite,* and/
the *Hypocrite* an able *Ranter.* His Church is/
the *Devil's* Chappel ; for it agrees exactly both/
in Doctorine and Diſicipline with the beſt reform-/
ed Baudy-Houſes.  He is a Monſter produced/
by the Madneſs of this latter Age ; but if it/
had been his Fate to have been whelped in old/
*Rome* he had paſt for a Prodigy, and been re-/
ceived among raining of Stones and the ſpeak-/
ing of Bulls, and would have put a ſtop to all/
public Affairs, until he had been expiated./
*Nero* cloathed *Chriſtians* in the Skins of wild/
Beaſts ; but he wraps wild Beaſts in the Skins/
of *Chriſtians*./
