#A RANTER/

I^2^s a *Fanatic* Hector, that has found out by a
very ſtrange Way of new Light, how to
transform all the *Devils* into *Angels of Light* ;
for he believes all Religion conſiſts in Looſeneſs,
and that Sin and Vice is *the whole Duty of Man*.
He puts off the *old Man*, but puts it on again upon
the *new one,* and makes his *Pagan* Vices ſerve to
preſerve his *Chriſtian* Virtues from wearing out ;
for if he ſhould uſe his Piety and Devotion al-
ways it would hold out but a little while.  He
is loth that Iniquity and Vice ſhould be thrown
away, as long as there may be good Uſe of it ;
for if that, which is wickedly gotten, may
be diſposed to pious Uſes, why ſhould not
Wickedneſs itſelf as well? He believes himſelf
Shot-free againſt all the Attempts of the *Devil,*
the *World,* and the *Flesh,* and therefore is not
afraid to attack them in their own Quarters,
and encounter them at their own Weapons.
