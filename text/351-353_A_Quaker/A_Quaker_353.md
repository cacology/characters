Gnaſhing of Teeth.  There was a Botcher of\
their Church, that renounced his Trade and\
turned Preacher, becauſe he held it ſuperſtiti-\

Diſtemper in the Brain, where the Nerves are\
rooted.  They abhor the Church of *England*,\
but conform exactly with thoſe primitive Fa-\
theres of their Church, that heretofore gave An-\
ſwers at the *Devil*’s Oracles, in which they ob-\

and gaping now practiſed by our modern En_\
thuſiaſts at their Exorciſms, rather than Ex-\
erciſes of Devotion.  He ſucks in the Air like\
a Pair of Bellows, and blows his inward Light\
with it, till he dung Fire, as Cattle do in *Lin*-\
*colnſhire*.  The general Ignorance of their\
whole Party make it appear, that whatſoever\
their Zeal may be, it is not *according to Know*-\
*ledge*.\
