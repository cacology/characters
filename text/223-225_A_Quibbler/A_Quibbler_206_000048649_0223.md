[*two rules*]#A\QUIBBLERI^2^s a Jugler of Words, that ſhows Tricks\with them, to make them appear what they\were not meant for, and ſerve two Senſes at\once, like one that plays on two *Jews* Trumps. \He is a Fencer of Language, that falſiſies his\Blow, and hits where he did not aim. He\Has a fooliſh Slight of Wit, that catches at\Words only, and lets the Senſe go, like the\young Thief in the Farce, that took a Purſe, \but gave the Owner his Money back again. \He is ſo well verſed in all Cafes of Quibble,\that he knows when there will be a Blot upon\a Word, as ſoon as it is out. He packs his\Quibbles like a Stock of Cards, let him but\ſhuffle, and cut where you will, he will be\ſure to have it.  He dances on a Rope of Sand,\does the *Somerſet*, *Strapado*, and half-ſlrapado\with Words, plays at all manner of Games\
