    A HUFFING COURTIER.     85
in a Casse, and is taken out again for the La-
dies to play upon, who when they have done
with him, let down his treble-String, till they
are in the Humour again.  His Cook and Va-
let de Chambre consspire to dress Dinner and
him sso puncctually together, that the one may
not be ready before the other.  As Peacocks and
Osstridges have the gaudiest and finest Feathers,
yet cannot fly;  sso all his Bravery is to flutter
only.  The Beggars call him [i] my Lord, [i] and he
takes them at their Words, and pays them for
it.  If ou praisse him, he is sso true and faith-
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make
you a Pressent of himsself, and will not be re-
fussed, tho' you know not what to do with him
when you have him.
