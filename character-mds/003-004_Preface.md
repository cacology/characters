#PREFACE.

*T^2^HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit*\
*much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt*\
*Century, The two principal Authors in this Way*\
*were Sir* Thomas Overbury, *and Dr.* John\
Earle *Tutor to Prince* Charles *in* 1643, *and after*\
*the Reſtoration Dean of* Weſtminſter, *and ſuc-*\
*ceſſively Biſhop of* Worceſter *and* Saliſbury. *How*\
*agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public*\
*Taſte may be judged from Sir* Thomas's *little Book*\
*having fourteen Editions before* 1632, *and the*\
*Biſhop's ſix between* 1628 *and* 1633. *Whether*\
Butler *has equalled or excelled them, and what*\
*Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt*\
*be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-*\
*reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me*\
*a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge.  The Reader*\
*will have an Opportunity of determining for him*\
*ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame*\
*Pictures.*\

  *As in ſuch a Variety of Characters there muſt*\
*be ſome drawn from Originals in general the ſame,*\
*and only differenced by particular Circumſtances,*\
*the ſame Obſervations are ſometimes repeated.*\
*Whether the Author in this Caſe requires any Apo-*\
*logy muſt be left to his Judges the Critics ;  it is*\
*enough for me that I can ſay I have done him*\
*Justice in publiſhing them.*

  *As moſt of theſe Characters are dated when they*\
*were compoſed, I can inform the curious, that they*\
*were chiefly drawn up from* 1667 *to* 1669, *at*\
*which time, as has been before obſerved,* Butler\
*reſided in* Wales *under the Protection of Lord*\
Carbery.
