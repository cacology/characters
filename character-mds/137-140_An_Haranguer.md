[I]s one, that is s*o delighted with the s*weet/ 
[I] Sound of his own Tongue, that [i] William\
Prynne [i] will s*ooner lend an Ear, than he, to any\
Thing els*e. His Meas*ure of Talk is till his\
Wind is s*pent; and then he is not s*ilenced,\
but becalmed. His Ears have catched the\
Itch of his Tonuge, and though he s*cratch\
them, like a Deas*t with his Hoof, he finds a\
Pleas*ure in it. A [i] s*ilenced Minis*ter, [i] has more\
Mercy on the Government in a s*ecure Conven-\
ticle, than he has on the Company, that he is\
in. He s*hakes a Man by the Ear, as a Dog\
does a Pig, and never loos*es his Hold, till he\
has tired hims*elf, as well as his Patient. He\
does not talk to a Man, but attack him, and\
whoms*oever he can get into his Hands he lays\
violent Language on. If he can he will run\
a Man up agains*t a Wall, and hold him at a\

Bay by the Buttons, which he handles as bad\
as he does his Pers*on, or the Bus*ines*s he treats\
upon. When he finds him begin to s*ink, he\
holds him by the Cloaths, and feels him as a\
Butcher does a Calf, before he kills him. He\
is a walking Pillory, and crucifies more Ears\
than a dozen s*tanding ones. He will hold any\
Argument rather than his Tongue, and main-\
tain both s*ides at his own Charge; for he will\
tell you what you will s*ay, though, perhaps,\
he does not intende to give you leave. He\
lugs Men by the Ears, as they correct Children\
in [i] Scotland, [i] and will make them tingle, while\
he talks with them, as s*ome s*ay they will do,\
whena  Man is talked of in his Abs*ence. When\
he talks to a Man, he comes up clos*e to him,\
and like an old Solider lets fly in his Face, or\
claps the Bore of his Pis*tol to his Ear, and\
whispers aloud, that he may be s*ure not to\
mis*s his Mark. His tongue is always in Mo-\
tion, tho very s*eldom to the Purpos*e, like a\
Barber's Scis*s*ers, which are always s*nipping,\
as well when they do not cut, as when they\
do. His Tongue is like a Bagpipe Drone, that\
has no Stop, but makes a continual ugly Nois*e,\
hims*elf. He never leaves a Man until he has\

run him down, and then he winds a Death\
over him. A Sow-Gelder's Horn is not s*o\
terrible to Dogs and Cats, as he is to all that\
know him. His Way of Argument is to talk\
all, and hear to Contradiction. Firs*t he gives\
his Antagonis*t the Length of the Wind, and\
then, let him make his Approaches inf he can,\
he is s*ure to be beforehand with him. Of all\
dis*s*olute Dis*eas*es the Running of the Tongue is\
the wors*t, and the hardes*t to be cured. If he\
happen at any time to be at a Stand, and any\
Man els*e begins to s*peak, he pres*ently drowns\
him with his Nois*e, as a Water-Dog makes a\
Duck dive: for when you think he has done\
he falls one, and lets fly again, like a Gun, that\
will dis*charge nine Times with one Loading.\
He is a Rattles*nake, that with his Nois*e gives\
Men warning to avoid him, otherwis*e he will\
make them wis*h they had. He is, like a Bell,\
good for nothing but to make a Nois*e. He is\
like common Fame, that s*peaks mos*t and\
knows leas*t, Lord [i] Brooks, [i] or a Wildgoos*e al-\
ways cackling when he is upon the Wing.\
His Tongue is like any Kind of Carriage, the\
les*s Weight it bears, the fas*ter and eas*ier it\
goes. He is s*o full of Words, that they run\
over, and are thrown away to no Purpos*e; and\

long in delivering hims*elf, that thos*e that hear\
him des*ire to be delivered too, or dis*patched\
out of their Pain. He makes his Dis*course the\
longer with often repeating [i] to be s*hort, [i] and talks\
much of [i] in fine, [i] but never means to come near\
it.\
