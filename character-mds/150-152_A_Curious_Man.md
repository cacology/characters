and s*crupulous of his Humour, as [i] Fantatics [i]/
are of their Cons*ciences, and both for the mos*t/

any Thing be, s*o it be but unus*ual and rare./
He collects all the Curious*ities he can light upon/
in Art or Nature, not to inform his own/
Judgement, but to catch the Admiration of o-/
thers, which he believes he has a Right to, be-/
caus*e the Rarities are his own. That which/
other Men neglect he believes they overs*ee,/
and s*tores up Trifles as rare Dis*coveries, at leas*t/
of his own Wit and Sagacity. He admires/
subtleties above all Things, becaus*e the more/
s*ubtle they are, the nearer they are to nothing;/
and values no Art but that which is s*pun s*o/

have an iron Chain hung about the Neck of a/
Flea, than an Alderman's of Gold, and [i] Ho-/

Curious*ities at length renders him one of them,/
and he s*hews hims*elf as none fo the meanes*t/

rity, that rather than follow the Fas*hion, that/
is us*ed by the res*t of the World, he will wear/
dis*s*enting Cloaths with odd fantas*tic Devices/

at his ill-employed Indus*try. He is one of/
