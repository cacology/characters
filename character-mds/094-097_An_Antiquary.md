# AN\
ANTIQUARY

I^2^s one that has his Being in this Age, but\
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of\
old.  He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-\
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great\
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like\
the Madman, that fell in Love with *Cleopatra*.\
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has\
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten\
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm\
in his Skull.  He honours his Forefathers and\
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as\
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts.  He\
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his\
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which\
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a\
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into\
the World.  He ſpends the one half of his\
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,\


---


and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes\
ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does\
it, the further they are from being new to him.\
All his Curiouſities take place of one another\
according to their Seniority, and he values\
them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.\
He has a great Veneration for Words that are\
ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that\
they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe\
he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-\
tiquity, and the good Services they have done.\
He throws away his Time in enquiring after\
that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,\
like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find\
out another that was loſt before.  He fetches\
things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable\
of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own\
Aſhes.  He values one old Invention, that is\
loſt and never to be recovered, before all the\
new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.\
The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with\
his, that ſhows the Tombs at *Westminster*, only\
the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other\
for Money.  As every Man has but one Fa-\
ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World\
of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value\


---


for Things that are antient, and the further off\
the greater.

   He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time\
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,\
but is wholly retied from the preſent.  His\
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came\
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is\
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of\
them.  He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to\
any Thing that is old, that he may truly *ſay to*\
*Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-*\
*tenneſs thou are my Mother*.  He has no Provi-\
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-\
tions look backward upon the Days of old,\
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he\
walked backwards.  He had rather interpret\
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-\
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious\
new one ; and with *Scaliger* would ſell the\
Empire of *Germany*[^1] (if it were in his Power)\
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-\
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths\
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values\


[^1]:   *And with* Scaliger *would ſell the Empire of Germany*]  This al-\
ludes to a ranting Exclamation of *Scaliger*’s upon an Ode in *Horace*,\
which he was particularly pleased with.

it above any Thing printed, which he accounts\
but a Novelty.  When he happens to cure a\
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud\
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,\
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.\
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-\
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are\
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the\
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds\
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they\
are made up.  He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch\
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince\
out of Uſe ; as the *Catholics* allow of no Saints,\
but ſuch as are dead, and the *Fanatics*, Op-\
poſition, of none but the Living.\
