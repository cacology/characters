[I]s one, that would fain make himself that,
[ ]which {i} Nature{i} never meant him; like a {i}Fa-
natic,{i} that insspires himsself with his own
Whimsses.  He ssets up Haberdassher of ssmall
Poetry, with a very ssmall Stock, and no Credit.
He believes it is Inventions enough to find out
other Men's Wit; and whatssoever he lights upon
either in Books, or Company, he makes bold
with as his own.  This he puts together sso un-
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit
has the Rickets, by the Sswelling Dissproportion
of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of him;
him; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that
he has catched of others; and his Flame like
that of Charcoals that were burnt before :
But as he wants Judgment to undersstand what
is besst, he naturally takes the worsst, as being
mosst agreeable to his own Talent.  You may

know his Wit not to be natural, 'tis sso un-
quiet and troublesome in him: For as thosse,
that have Money but sseldom, are always sshak-
ing their Pockets, when they have it; sso does
he, when he thinks he has got ssomething, that
will make him appear.  He is a perpetual Tal-
ker; and you may know by the Freedom of his
Disscoursse, that he came light by it, as Thieves
sspend fiercely what they get.  He meassures other
Men's Wits by {i}their{i} Modessty, and his own by
{i}his{i} Confidence. He makes nothing of writing
Plays, becausse he has not Wit enough to un-
derstand the Difficulty.  This makes him ven-ture
to talk and sscribble, as Chowsses do to play
with cunning Gamessters, until they are
cheated and laughed at.  He is always talking of Wit,
as thosse, that have bad Voices, are always ssing-
ing out of Tune; and thosse, that cannot play,
delight to fumble on Insstruments.  He grows
the unwisser by other Men's Harms; for the
worsse others write, he finds the more Encou-
ragement to do sso too.  His Greedinesss of
Praisse is sso eager, that he sswallows any Thing,
that comes in the Likenesss of it, how notorious
and palpable ssoever, and is as Shot-free againsst
any Thing, that may lessssen his good Opinion

of himsself--This renders him incurable, like
Disseasses, that grow inssensible.

  If you disslike him it is at your own Peril;
he is ssure to put in a Caveat beforehand againsst
your Understanding; and, like a Malefac-tor
in Wit, is always fursinssed with Exceptions
against his Judges. This puts him upon perpe-
tual Apologies, Excusses, and Defences, but
sstil by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-
fling Strain, without Regard of any Man,
that sstands in the Way of his Pageant.
Where he thinks he may do it ssafely, he
will confidently own other Men's Writings;
and where he fears the Truth may be disscovered,
he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inssinua-
tions give Men Occassion to ssupposse sso.

If he undersstands [i] Latin [i] or [i] Greek [i] he ranks
himsself among the Learned, desspisses the Igno-
rant, talks Criticissms out of [i] Scaliger[i], and re-
peats [i] Martial's [i] baudy Epigrams, and ssets up
his Resst wholly upon Pedantry.  But if he be
not sso well qualified, he crys down all Learning
as pedantic, dissclaims Study, and professsses to
write with as great Facility, as if his Musse was

ssliding down [i]Parnassssus[i]. Whatssoever he hears
well ssaid he sseizes upon by poetical Licence;
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill
repeating of it--This he believes to be no
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others
throw away.  By this means his Writings are,
like a Taylor's Cusshion, of mossaic Work,
made up of sseveral Scraps ssewed together,
He calls a sslovenly nassty Desscription [i] great Na-
ture,[i] and dull Flatnesss [i] strange Eassiness.[i]  He
writes down all that comes in his Head, and
makes no Choice, becausse he has nothing to
do it with, that is Judgment.  He is always
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like
the [i] long Parliament [i] making [i] Ordinances [i] in their
Stead; although they are perpetually [i] thrown
out [i] of Coffee-Housses, and come to Nothing.
He is like an [i]Italian [i] Thief, that never robs,
but he murthers, to prevent Disscovery; sso ssure
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may passs
unssusspec-ted.  He is byt a Copier at besst, and
will never arrive to prac-tice by the Life: For
bar him the Imitation of ssomething he has
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.

 [i] Whatssoever he hears well ssaid, &tc.[i]] In this Butler alludes to
[i] Martial's [i] Epigram to [i] Fidentinus.

Obs*ervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form
of jus*t Wit, are above his Philos*ophy.  He
appears s*o over concerned in all Men's Wits,
as if they were but Dis*paragements of his
own; and crys down all they do, as if they
were Encroachments upon him. He takes
Jes*ts fromt he Owners and breaks them, as
[i] Justices[i] do fals*e Weights, and Pots that want
Meas*ure.  When he meets with any Thing,
that is very good, he change it into s*mall
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to
s*erve s*everal Occas*ions.  He dis*claims Study,
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to s*hoot
flying, which appears to be very true by his
often mis*s*ing of his Mark.  His Wit is much
troubled with Obs*truc_tions;  and he has Fits as
painful as thos*e of the Spleen.   He fancies him-
s*elf a dainty s*pruce Shepherd, with a Flock and
a fine s*ilken Shepherds*s, that follows his Pipe,
as Rats did the Conjurers in [i] Germany.[i]

As for [i] Epithets, [i] he always avoids those, that
are near akin to the Sens*se.  Such matches are
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a [i] Chris*tian[i]
Poet; and therefore all his Care is to chus*e out

s*uch, as will s*erve, like a wooden Leg, to piece
out a main'd Vers*e, that wants a Foot or two;
and if they will buy rhimes now and then into
the Bargain, or run upon a Letter, it is a Work
of Supererrogation.

  For [i] Similtudes,[i] he likes the hardes*t and mos*t
obs*cure bes*t: For as Ladies wear black Patches,
to make their Complexions s*eem fairer than
they are; s*o when an Illus*tration is more ob-
s*cure than the Sens*e that went before it, it mus*t
of Neces*s*ity make it appear clearer than it
did: For Contraries are bes*t s*et off with Con-
traries.

    He has found out a Way to s*ave the Expence
of much Wit and Sens*e: For he will make
les*s than s*ome have prodigally laid out upon
five or s*ix Words s*erve forty or fifty Lines.
This is a thrifty Invention, and very eas*y; and,
if it were commonly known, would much in-
creas*e the Trade of Wit, and maintain a Mul-

He has found out a new Sort of poetical [i]Geor-
gics, [i] a Trick of s*owing Wit like clover-gras*s
on barren Subjec_ts, which would yield nothing
before. This is very us*eful for the Times,
wherein, s*ome men s*ay, there is no Room left
for new Invention.  He will take three Grains
of Wit like the Elixir, and projec_ting it upon
the [i] Iron-Age [i] turns it immediately into [i] Gold--[i]
All the Bus*iness of Mankind has pres*ently
vanis*hed, the whole World has kept Holiday;
there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdes*s*es;
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed
Plum-Porrige.

    We read that [i] Virgil [i] us*ed to make fifty or
    s*ixty Vers*es in a Morning, and afterwards re-
    duce them to ten. This was an unthrifty
    Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the
    Hus*bandry of his own Poetry, as [i] Seneca [i] s*ays
    he was in that of a Farm; for in plain [i] Englis*h[i]

      [i] As Seneca s*ays he was in that of a farm.] Seneca [i] in his 86th

it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine-
pence.  And as s*uch Cours*es brough the
[i] prodigal Son [i] to eat with Hogs: So they did him
to feed with Hors*es, which were not much
better Company, and may teach us to avoid
doing the like.  For certainly it is more noble
to take four or five Grains of Sens*e, and, like
a Gold-Beater, hammer them into s*o many
Leaves as will fill a whole Book; than to write
nothing but Epitomes, which many wife Men
believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.

   When he writes, he commonly s*teers the
Sens*e of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the
End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the
Tail.  For when he has made one Line, which
is eas*y enough; and has found out s*ome s*turdy
hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham-
mer the Sens*e upon it, like a Piece of hot Iron
upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleas*es.

   There is no Art in the World s*o rich in
Terms as Poetry; a whole Dic_tionary is s*carce

  [i] So they did him to feed with Hors*es]  This mus*t be explained by
  the s*ame Writer of [i] Virgil's[i] Life, who informs us that [Virgil] in
  his Youth s*tudied Phys*ic, in which having made great Proficiency,
  he repaired to [i] Rome, [i] and applying hims*elf to that Branch of it

able to contain them: For there is hardly a
Pond, a Sheep-walk, or a Gravel-pit in all
[i] Greece, [i] but the antient Name of it is become
a Term of Art in Poetry.  By this means s*mall
Poets have s*uch a Stock of able hard Words lying
by them, as [i] Dryades, Hamadryades, Aonides, Fauni,
Nymphae, Sylvani, &c.[i] that s*ignify nothing at all;
and s*uch a World of pedantic Terms of the
s*ame Kind, as may s*erve to furnis*h all the new
Inventions and [i] thorough-Reformations, [i] that can
happen between this and [i] Plato's[i] great Year.

  When he writes he never proposes any Scope
or Purpos*e to hims*elf, but gives h Genius all
Freedom: For as he, that rides abroad for his
Pleas*ure, can hardly be out of his Way; s*o he
that writes for his Pleas*ure, can s*eldom be be-
s*ide his Subjec_t.  It is an ungrateful Thing to
a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing---
To what Purpos*e did the Antients feign [i] Pegas*us
to have Wings, if he mus*t be confined to the
Road and Stages  like a Pack-Hors*e, or be forced
to be obedient to Hedges and Ditches? There-

which relates to the Dis*tempers of Hors*es, was employed in [i] Ae-
gustus's Stableswith great Succes*s, and by that Means introduced
hims*elf into the Favour of that Prince.

Pers*ons, Times, and Places is a Res*traint too
s*ervile to e impos*ed upon poetical Licence;

  He'll take s*cant Piece of coars*e Sens*e, and
s*tretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a s*core
Rhimes, utnil it crack that you may s*ee through
it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head. When

Pros*e Collec_tions called [i]Criticis*ms upon Books and Autohrs, [i] will ex-
plain--[i] Persius, [i] s*ays, he commits a very great Abs*urdity, when
laying the Scene of his fourth Satyr in [i] Greece [i], and bringing in [i] So-
crates reproving a young statesmen, he makes him call the [i] Gre-
cians  [i] Quirites.

were tougher than Bras*s, and harder than
Marble;  what would they have done, if they

lebrate the learned Author's Merits, as they
would s*hew, but their own Wits, of which he
is but the Subjec_t.  The Letchery of this Va-
nity has s*pawned more Writers than the [i] civil
Law: [i] For thos*e, whos*e Modes*ty mus*t notorious Va-
pours imaginable.  For if the Privilege of
Love be allowed--[i] Dicere quae* puduit, s*cribere
jus*s*it Amor,[i] why s*hould it not be s*o in Self-
Love too? For if it be Wis*dom to conceal our
Imperfec_tions, what is it to dis*cover our Vir-
tues? It is not like, that [i] Nature [i] gave Men
great Parts upon s*uch Terms, as the [i] Fairies [i]

if they s*peak of it.  They s*ay--[i]Prais*e is but

Paper of [i] Benlows*e'[i]s Poetry--[i] Prynne [i] bought it
by Chance, and put a new Demi-Cas*tor into
it.  The firs*t Time he wore it he felt only a
s*inging in his Head, which within two Days
turned to a Vertigo--He was let Blood in the
Ear by one of the State-Phys*icians, and reco-
vered; but before he went abroad he writ a
Poem of Rocks and Seas, in a Stile s*o proper
and natural, that it was hard to determine,
which was ruggeder.
