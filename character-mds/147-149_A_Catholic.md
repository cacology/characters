[S]AYS his Prayers often, but never prays, and/
[S] wors*hips the Cros*s more than (i) Christ (i). He/
prefers his Church merely for the Antiquity of/
it, and cares not how s*ound or rotten it be,/
s*o it be but old. He takes a liking to it as/
s*ome do to old Chees*e, only for the blue Rot-/
tennes*s of it. If he had lived in the primitive/
Times he had never been a (i) Christian (i); for the/
Antiquity of the (i) Pagan (i) and (i) Jewish (i) Religion/
would have had the s*ame Power over him/
against the (i) Christian, (i) as the old (i) Roman (i) has/
agains*t the modern Reformation. The weaker/
Ves*s*el he is, the better and more zealous Member/
he always proves of his Church; for Religion,/
like Wine, is not s*o apt to leak in a leathern/
Boraccio as a great Cas*k, and is better pre-/
s*erved in a s*mall Bottle s*topped with a light/
Cork, than a ves*s*el of greater Capacity, where/
the Spirits being more and s*tronger are the/

more apt to fret. He allows of all holy Cheats,/
and in content to be deluded in a true, ortho-/
dox, and infallible Way. He believes the (i) Pope (i)/
to be infallible, becaus*e he has deceived all the/
World, but was never deceived hims*elf, which/
was grown s*o notorious, that nothing les*s than/
an Article of Faith in the Church would make/
a Plas*ter big enough for the Sore. His Faith/
is too big for his Charity, and too unwieldy/
to work Miracles ; but is able to believe more/
than all the Sainst in Heave ever made.  He/
worships Sainst in Effigie, as (i) Dutchmen (i) hand/
abs*ent Malefactors ; and has s*o weak a Me-/
mory, that he is apt to forget his Patrons,/
unles*s their Pictures prevent him. He loves/
so s*ee what he prays to, that he may not mis-/
take one Saint for another ; and his Beads and/
Crucifix are the Tools of his Devotion, with-/
out which it can do nothing. Nothing s*taggers/
his Faith of the (i) Pope's (i) Infallibility s*o much,/
as that he did not make away the Scriptures,/
when they were in his Power, rather than/
thos*e that believed in them, which he knows/
not how to unders*tand to be no Error. The/
les*s he unders*tands of his Religion, the more/
violent he is in it, which, being the perpetual/
Condition of all thos*e are deluded, is a/

great Argument that he is miſtaken. His Re-/
ligion is of no Force without Ceremonies, like/
a Loads*tone that draws a greater Weight/
through a Piece of Iron, than when it is naked/
of it s*elf. His Prayers are a kind of Crambe/
that uſed to kill Schoolmaſters ; and he values/
them by Number, not Weight./
