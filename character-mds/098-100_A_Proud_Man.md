#PROUD MAN/
/
I^2^<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span> a Fool in Fermentation, that ſwells and/
boils over like a Porridge-Pot.  He ſets out/
his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem/
bigger than he is.  He is troubled with a Tu-/
mour and Inflammation of Self-Conceit, that/
renders every Part of him ſtiff and uneaſy./
He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-/
der, that works upon him to Dotage, and has/
transformed him into his own Miſtreſs.  He/
is his own Gallant, and makes moſt paſſionate/
Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections.  He/
commits Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips/
his own Image ; though there is no Soul living/
of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes as/
the Church believes, and maintains his Faith/
with the Obſtinacy of a *Fanatic.* He is his own/
Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above/
his Merit, but all Mankind ; is both *Damon*/
and *Pythias* to his own dear ſelf, and values his/

Crony above his Soul.  He gives Place to no/
Man but himſelf, and that with very great/
Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems not/
worthy to approach him.  He believes what-/
ſoever he has receives a Value in being his ;/
as a Horſe in a Nobleman's Stable will bear a/
greater Price than in a common Market.  He/
is ſo proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted with/
himſelf as with others ; for he is very/
apt to forget who he is, and knows himſelf/
only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats himſelf/
civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and Com-/
pliment, but admist of no Privacy.  He ſtrives/
to look bigger than himſelf, as well as others,/
and is no better than his own Paraſite and/
Flatterer.  A little Flood will make a ſhallow/
Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and/
foam, and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep/
ſilent Stream glides quietly on.  So a vain-/
glorious inſolent proud Man ſells with a little/
frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-/
flows his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves/
Mud and Dirt behind him.  His Carriage is/
as glorious and haughty, as if he were advan-/
ced upon Men's Shoulders, or tumbled over/
their Heads like Knipperdolling.  He fancies/ 


---


himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head/
holds no Proportion to his Body, and his foun-/
dation is leſſer than his upper Stories.  We/
can naturally take no view of our ſelves, un-/
leſs we look downwards, to teach us how/
humble Admirers we ought to be of our own/
Values.  The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his Mate-/
rials are, the more Room they take up, and/
make him ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and/
Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions better than Things/
of more cloſe and ſolid Parts./
