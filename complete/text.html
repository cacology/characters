<h1 id="preface.">PREFACE.</h1>
<p><em>T<sup>2</sup>HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit</em><br />
<em>much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt</em><br />
<em>Century. The two principal Authors in this Way</em><br />
<em>were Sir</em> Thomas Overbury, <em>and Dr.</em> John<br />
Earle <em>Tutor to Prince</em> Charles <em>in</em> 1643, <em>and after</em><br />
<em>the Reſtoration Dean of</em> Weſtminſter, <em>and ſuc-</em><br />
<em>ceſſively Biſhop of</em> Worceſter <em>and</em> Saliſbury. <em>How</em><br />
<em>agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public</em><br />
<em>Taſte may be judged from Sir</em> Thomas’s <em>little Book</em><br />
<em>having fourteen Editions before</em> 1632, <em>and the</em><br />
<em>Biſhop’s ſix between</em> 1628 <em>and</em> 1633. <em>Whether</em><br />
Butler <em>has equalled or excelled them, and what</em><br />
<em>Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt</em><br />
<em>be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-</em><br />
<em>reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me</em><br />
<em>a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge. The Reader</em><br />
<em>will have an Opportunity of determining for him-</em><br />
<em>ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame</em><br />
<em>Pictures.</em><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p><em>As in ſuch a Variety of Characters there muſt</em><br />
<em>be ſome drawn from Originals in general the ſame,</em><br />
<em>and only differenced by particular Circumſtances,</em><br />
<em>the ſame Obſervations are ſometimes repeated.</em><br />
<em>Whether the Author in this Caſe requires any Apo-</em><br />
<em>logy muſt be left to his Judges the Critics ; it is</em><br />
<em>enough for me that I can ſay I have done him</em><br />
<em>Justice in publiſhing them.</em></p>
<p><em>As moſt of theſe Characters are dated when they</em><br />
<em>were compoſed, I can inform the curious, that they</em><br />
<em>were chiefly drawn up from</em> 1667 <em>to</em> 1669, <em>at</em><br />
<em>which time, as has been before obſerved,</em> Butler<br />
<em>reſided in</em> Wales <em>under the Protection of Lord</em><br />
Carbery.<br />

<p>I<sup>2</sup>s a Cypher, that has no Value himſelf, but<br />
from the Place he ſtands in. All his Hap-<br />
pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others<br />
have of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-<br />
retical and erroneous, though he ſuffer much<br />
Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate, and<br />
not to be convinced. He flutters up and down<br />
like a Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is<br />
pruning of his Peruque takes Occaſion to con-<br />
template his Legs, and the Symmetry of his<br />
Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the<br />
Rooms, and ſerves for a walking Picture, a<br />
moving Piece of Arras. His Buſineſs is only<br />
to be ſeen, and he performs it with admirable<br />
Industry, placing himself always in the beſt<br />
Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-<br />
tious whom he mixes withal. His Occupation<br />
is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if they could but<br />
walk themselves, they would ſave him the </p>
<hr />
<p>Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.<br />
His Immunity from Varlets is his Freehold,<br />
and he were a loſt Man without it. His<br />
Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he<br />
gives him, for ’tis ten to one he never pays for<br />
them. He is very careful to diſcover the Lining<br />
of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect any<br />
Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the<br />
Skin outwards. His Taylor is his Creator,<br />
and makes him of nothing ; and though he<br />
lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_<br />
mitting Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells<br />
in the Outſide of him, like that of a hollow<br />
Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off him<br />
he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of<br />
himſelf is the wearing of his Cloaths, and,<br />
like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is better than<br />
his Body. His looking big is rather a Tumor,<br />
than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt<br />
ſo much Value, as other Men give him that<br />
believe in him, but none of his own. He<br />
makes him Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like<br />
a Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get<br />
through. He has juſt ſo much of Politics, as<br />
Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have <em>Latin</em>. He is<br />
as humble as a Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that<br />
are below him ; and with a generous Scorn<br />
deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither do him good,<br />
nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do him<br />
good, though he knows they never will ; and<br />
deſpiſes thoſe, that would not hurt him, if<br />
they could. The Court is his Church, and he<br />
believes as that believes, and cries up and down<br />
every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a<br />
great Comfort to him to think, that ſome who<br />
do not know him may perhaps take him for a<br />
Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he looks<br />
bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-<br />
tance ; and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-<br />
times know you, and ſometimes not. Nothing<br />
but want of Money or Credit puts him in<br />
mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts<br />
Providence that ſomebody will truſt him ; and<br />
in Expectation of that hopes for a better Life,<br />
and that his Debts will never riſe up in Judg-<br />
ment against him. To get in debt is to labour<br />
in his Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his<br />
Protection ; for what’s that worth to one that<br />
owes Nothing ? His Employment being only to<br />
wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his<br />
Life and Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers<br />
Books, that are his faithful Hiſtoriographers to<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes<br />
ſo much Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;<br />
and that no Man wears his Cloaths in Faſhion,<br />
that pays for them, for noting is further from<br />
the Mode. He believes that he that runs in<br />
Debt is beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,<br />
and only thoſe, that pay, are behind. His<br />
Brains are turned giddy, like one that walks<br />
on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon<br />
it is ſo troubleſome to him to look downwards.<br />
He is a Kind of Spectrum, and his Cloaths are<br />
the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ; and<br />
when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs<br />
as buſily out of one Room into another, as a<br />
great Practiſer does in <em>Weſtminſter</em>-Hall from<br />
one Court to another. When he accoſts a<br />
Lady he puts both Ends of his Microcoſm in<br />
Motion, by making Legs at one End, and<br />
combing his Peruque at the other. His Gar-<br />
niture is the Sauce to his Cloaths, and he walks<br />
in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in long<br />
Graſs. Every Motion of him crys <em>Vanity of</em><br />
<em>Vanities, all is Vanity,</em> quoth the Preacher. He<br />
rides himself like a well-managed Horſe, reins<br />
in his Neck, and walks <em>Terra Terra</em>. He<br />
carries his elbows backward, as if he were<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as<br />
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit. His Legs are<br />
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like<br />
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant<br />
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not<br />
cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long<br />
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now<br />
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover<br />
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of<br />
Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of<br />
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,<br />
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being<br />
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When he<br />
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-<br />
men do their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons<br />
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a<br />
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,<br />
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-<br />
rows from Reflection. He is as tender of his<br />
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as<br />
loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery<br />
is all his Happineſs ; and like <em>Atlas</em> he carries<br />
his Heaven on his Back. He is like the golden<br />
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He<br />
is a Monſter or an <em>Indian</em> Creature, that is<br />
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.<br />
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-<br />
dies to play upon, who when they have done<br />
with him, let down his treble-String, till they<br />
are in the Humour again. His Cook and Va-<br />
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and<br />
him ſo punctually together, that the one may<br />
not be ready before the other. As Peacocks and<br />
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,<br />
yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to flutter<br />
only. The Beggars call him <em>my Lord,</em> and he<br />
takes them at their Words, and pays them for<br />
it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-<br />
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make<br />
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-<br />
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him<br />
when you have him.<br />

ANTIQUARY</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>s one that has his Being in this Age, but<br />
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of<br />
old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-<br />
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great<br />
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like<br />
the Madman, that fell in Love with <em>Cleopatra</em>.<br />
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has<br />
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten<br />
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm<br />
in his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and<br />
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as<br />
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts. He<br />
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his<br />
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which<br />
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a<br />
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into<br />
the World. He ſpends the one half of his<br />
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes<br />
ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does<br />
it, the further they are from being new to him.<br />
All his Curiouſities take place of one another<br />
according to their Seniority, and he values<br />
them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.<br />
He has a great Veneration for Words that are<br />
ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that<br />
they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe<br />
he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-<br />
tiquity, and the good Services they have done.<br />
He throws away his Time in enquiring after<br />
that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,<br />
like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find<br />
out another that was loſt before. He fetches<br />
things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable<br />
of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own<br />
Aſhes. He values one old Invention, that is<br />
loſt and never to be recovered, before all the<br />
new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.<br />
The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with<br />
his, that ſhows the Tombs at <em>Westminster</em>, only<br />
the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other<br />
for Money. As every Man has but one Fa-<br />
ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World<br />
of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>for Things that are antient, and the further off<br />
the greater.</p>
<p>He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time<br />
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,<br />
but is wholly retied from the preſent. His<br />
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came<br />
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is<br />
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of<br />
them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to<br />
any Thing that is old, that he may truly <em>ſay to</em><br />
<em>Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-</em><br />
<em>tenneſs thou are my Mother</em>. He has no Provi-<br />
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-<br />
tions look backward upon the Days of old,<br />
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he<br />
walked backwards. He had rather interpret<br />
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-<br />
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious<br />
new one ; and with <em>Scaliger</em> would ſell the<br />
Empire of <em>Germany</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (if it were in his Power)<br />
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-<br />
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths<br />
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>it above any Thing printed, which he accounts<br />
but a Novelty. When he happens to cure a<br />
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud<br />
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,<br />
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.<br />
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-<br />
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are<br />
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the<br />
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds<br />
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they<br />
are made up. He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch<br />
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince<br />
out of Uſe ; as the <em>Catholics</em> allow of no Saints,<br />
but ſuch as are dead, and the <em>Fanatics</em>, Op-<br />
poſition, of none but the Living.<br />

PROUD MAN</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S a Fool in Fermentation, that ſwells and<br />
boils over like a Porridge-Pot. He ſets out<br />
his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem<br />
bigger than he is. He is troubled with a Tu-<br />
mour and Inflammation of Self-Conceit, that<br />
renders every Part of him ſtiff and uneaſy.<br />
He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-<br />
der, that works upon him to Dotage, and has<br />
transformed him into his own Miſtreſs. He<br />
is his own Gallant, and makes moſt paſſionate<br />
Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections. He<br />
commits Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips<br />
his own Image ; though there is no Soul living<br />
of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes as<br />
the Church believes, and maintains his Faith<br />
with the Obſtinacy of a <em>Fanatic.</em> He is his own<br />
Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above<br />
his Merit, but all Mankind ; is both <em>Damon</em><br />
and <em>Pythias</em> to his own dear ſelf, and values his<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Crony above his Soul. He gives Place to no<br />
Man but himſelf, and that with very great<br />
Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems not<br />
worthy to approach him. He believes what-<br />
ſoever he has receives a Value in being his ;<br />
as a Horſe in a Nobleman’s Stable will bear a<br />
greater Price than in a common Market. He<br />
is ſo proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted<br />
with himſelf as with others ; for he is very<br />
apt to forget who he is, and knows himſelf<br />
only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats himſelf<br />
civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and Com-<br />
pliment, but admits of no Privacy. He ſtrives<br />
to look bigger than himſelf, as well as others,<br />
and is no better than his own Paraſite and<br />
Flatterer. A little Flood will make a ſhallow<br />
Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and<br />
foam, and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep<br />
ſilent Stream glides quietly on. So a vain-<br />
glorious inſolent proud Man ſwells with a little<br />
frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-<br />
flows his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves<br />
Mud and Dirt behind him. His Carriage is<br />
as glorious and haughty, as if he were advan-<br />
ced upon Men’s Shoulders, or tumbled over<br />
their Heads like Knipperdolling. He fancies/</p>
<hr />
<p>himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head<br />
holds no Proportion to his Body, and his foun-<br />
dation is leſſer than his upper Stories. We<br />
can naturally take no view of our ſelves, un-<br />
leſs we look downwards, to teach us how<br />
humble Admirers we ought to be of our own<br />
Values. The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his Mate-<br />
rials are, the more Room they take up, and<br />
make him ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and<br />
Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions better than Things<br />
of more cloſe and ſolid Parts.<br />

#FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S one, that is not contented to be a Privy-<br />
Counſellor of the Kingdom of Heaven, but<br />
would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,<br />
and tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the<br />
Kingdom of Earth. His Deſign is to make<br />
<em>Chriſt</em> King, as his Forefathers the <em>Jew</em> did,<br />
only to abuſe and crucify him, that he might<br />
ſhare his Lands and Goods, as he did his Vice-<br />
gerents here. He dreams of a Fool's Paradiſe<br />
without a Serpent in it, a golden Age all of<br />
Saints, and no Hypocrites, all <em>holy-Court</em> Princes,<br />
and no Subjects but the Wicked ; a Govern-<br />
ment of <em>Perkin Warbec</em> and <em>Lambert Simnel</em><br />
Saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it,<br />
might make himſelf a Price, and claim a<br />
Title to the Crown. He fancies a <em>fifth-Mo-</em><br />
<em>narchy</em> as the Quinteſſence of all Governments,<br />
abſtracted from all Matter, and conſiſting<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and Myſteries.<br />
<em>John</em> of <em>Leyden</em> was the firſt Founder of it, and<br />
though he miſcarried, like <em>Romulus</em> in a Tem-<br />
peſt, his Poſterity have Revelations every full<br />
Moon, that there may be a Time to ſet up his<br />
Title again, and with better Succeſs ; though<br />
his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had<br />
no ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,<br />
but their whole outward Men were ſet on the<br />
Gates of the City ; where a Head and four<br />
Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of the<br />
<em>fifth-Monarchy.</em> They have been contriving (ſince<br />
Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-<br />
ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed King<br />
<em>Oberon,</em> to erect their Monarchy in <em>Fairy-Land,</em><br />
as being the moſt proper and natural Region in<br />
the whole World for their Government, and if<br />
it ſucceed there to proceed further. The <em>De-</em><br />
<em>vil's</em> Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,<br />
and the Glory of them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,<br />
that they would venture their Necks to take<br />
him at his Word, and give him his Price.<br />
Nothing comes ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-<br />
neſs as the <em>fifth-Monarchy,</em> that is no where to<br />
be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-<br />
thologies, and myſtical Riddles, like the Vi-<br />
ſions <em>Aeneas</em> ſaw in Hell of the <em>Roman</em> Empire.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Next this it moſt reſembles <em>Mahomet</em>’s Coming<br />
to the <em>Turks,</em> and King <em>Arthur</em>’s Reign over the<br />
Britons in <em>Merlin</em>’s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin<br />
are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern<br />
the ſame Lineaments in them all. The poor<br />
Wicked are like to have a very ill time under<br />
them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-<br />
vernment, according to their ancient and fun-<br />
damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects<br />
but Slaves, who between them and the <em>Devil</em><br />
are like to ſuffer Perſecution enough to make<br />
them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-<br />
ters. He gathers Churches on the Sunday, as<br />
the <em>Jews</em> did Sticks on their Sabbath, to ſet the<br />
State on Fire. He humms and hahs high Trea-<br />
ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the<br />
Caſt they would throw. He groans Sedition,<br />
and, like the <em>Phariſee,</em> rails, when he gives<br />
Thanks. He interprets Propheſies, as <em>Whitting-<br />
ton</em> did the Bells, to ſpeak to him, and governs<br />
himſelf accordingly.<br />

He is always talking of Wit, as thosse, that have bad Voices, are always ssing- ing out of Tune; and thosse, that cannot play, delight to fumble on Insstruments. He grows the unwisser by other Men's Harms; for the worsse others write, he finds the more Encou- ragement to do sso too. His Greedinesss of Praisse is sso eager, that he sswallows any Thing, that comes in the Likenesss of it, how notorious and palpable ssoever, and is as Shot-free againsst any Thing, that may lessssen his good Opinion</p>

<p>If you disslike him it is at your own Peril; he is ssure to put in a Caveat beforehand againsst your Understanding; and, like a Malefac-tor in Wit, is always fursinssed with Exceptions against his Judges. This puts him upon perpe- tual Apologies, Excusses, and Defences, but sstil by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif- fling Strain, without Regard of any Man, that sstands in the Way of his Pageant. Where he thinks he may do it ssafely, he will confidently own other Men's Writings; and where he fears the Truth may be disscovered, he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inssinua- tions give Men Occassion to ssupposse sso.</p>
<p>If he undersstands [i] Latin [i] or [i] Greek [i] he ranks himsself among the Learned, desspisses the Igno- rant, talks Criticissms out of [i] Scaliger[i], and re- peats [i] Martial's [i] baudy Epigrams, and ssets up his Resst wholly upon Pedantry.

Whatssoever he hears well ssaid he sseizes upon by poetical Licence; and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill repeating of it--This he believes to be no more Theft, than it is to take that, which others throw away. By this means his Writings are, like a Taylor's Cusshion, of mossaic Work, made up of sseveral Scraps ssewed together, He calls a sslovenly nassty Desscription [i] great Na- ture,[i] and dull Flatnesss [i] strange Eassiness.[i] He writes down all that comes in his Head, and makes no Choice, becausse he has nothing to do it with, that is Judgment. He is always repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like the [i] long Parliament [i] making [i] Ordinances [i] in their Stead; although they are perpetually [i] thrown out [i] of Coffee-Housses, and come to Nothing. He is like an [i]Italian [i] Thief, that never robs, but he murthers, to prevent Disscovery; sso ssure is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur- loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may passs unssusspec-ted. He is byt a Copier at besst, and will never arrive to prac-tice by the Life: For bar him the Imitation of ssomething he has read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.</p>

<p>Obs<em>ervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form of jus</em>t Wit, are above his Philos<em>ophy. He appears s</em>o over concerned in all Men's Wits, as if they were but Dis<em>paragements of his own; and crys down all they do, as if they were Encroachments upon him. He takes Jes</em>ts fromt he Owners and breaks them, as [i] Justices[i] do fals<em>e Weights, and Pots that want Meas</em>ure. When he meets with any Thing, that is very good, he change it into s<em>mall Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to s</em>erve s<em>everal Occas</em>ions. He dis<em>claims Study, pretends to take Things in Motion, and to s</em>hoot flying, which appears to be very true by his often mis<em>s</em>ing of his Mark. His Wit is much troubled with Obs<em>truc_tions; and he has Fits as painful as thos</em>e of the Spleen. He fancies him- s<em>elf a dainty s</em>pruce Shepherd, with a Flock and a fine s<em>ilken Shepherds</em>s, that follows his Pipe, as Rats did the Conjurers in [i] Germany.[i]</p>
<p>As for [i] Epithets, [i] he always avoids those, that are near akin to the Sens<em>se. Such matches are unlawful, and not fit to be made by a [i] Chris</em>tian[i] Poet; and therefore all his Care is to chus*e out</p>

And as s<em>uch Cours</em>es brough the [i] prodigal Son [i] to eat with Hogs: So they did him to feed with Hors<em>es, which were not much better Company, and may teach us to avoid doing the like. For certainly it is more noble to take four or five Grains of Sens</em>e, and, like a Gold-Beater, hammer them into s*o many Leaves as will fill a whole Book; than to write nothing but Epitomes, which many wife Men believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.</p>
<p>When he writes, he commonly s<em>teers the Sens</em>e of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the Tail.
