<h1 id="preface.">PREFACE.</h1>
<p><em>T<sup>2</sup>HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit</em><br />
<em>much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt</em><br />
<em>Century, The two principal Authors in this Way</em><br />
<em>were Sir</em> Thomas Overbury, <em>and Dr.</em> John<br />
Earle <em>Tutor to Prince</em> Charles <em>in</em> 1643, <em>and after</em><br />
<em>the Reſtoration Dean of</em> Weſtminſter, <em>and ſuc-</em><br />
<em>ceſſively Biſhop of</em> Worceſter <em>and</em> Saliſbury. <em>How</em><br />
<em>agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public</em><br />
<em>Taſte may be judged from Sir</em> Thomas's <em>little Book</em><br />
<em>having fourteen Editions before</em> 1632, <em>and the</em><br />
<em>Biſhop's ſix between</em> 1628 <em>and</em> 1633. <em>Whether</em><br />
Butler <em>has equalled or excelled them, and what</em><br />
<em>Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt</em><br />
<em>be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-</em><br />
<em>reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me</em><br />
<em>a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge. The Reader</em><br />
<em>will have an Opportunity of determining for him</em><br />
<em>ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame</em><br />
<em>Pictures.</em><br />
</p>
<hr />
<p><em>As in ſuch a Variety of Characters there muſt</em><br />
<em>be ſome drawn from Originals in general the ſame,</em><br />
<em>and only differenced by particular Circumſtances,</em><br />
<em>the ſame Obſervations are ſometimes repeated.</em><br />
<em>Whether the Author in this Caſe requires any Apo-</em><br />
<em>logy muſt be left to his Judges the Critics ; it is</em><br />
<em>enough for me that I can ſay I have done him</em><br />
<em>Justice in publiſhing them.</em></p>
<p><em>As moſt of theſe Characters are dated when they</em><br />
<em>were compoſed, I can inform the curious, that they</em><br />
<em>were chiefly drawn up from</em> 1667 <em>to</em> 1669, <em>at</em><br />
<em>which time, as has been before obſerved,</em> Butler<br />
<em>reſided in</em> Wales <em>under the Protection of Lord</em><br />
Carbery.</p>

HUFFING COURTIER</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>s a Cypher, that has no Value himſelf, but<br />
from the Place he ſtands in. All his Hap-<br />
pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others<br />
have of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-<br />
retical and erroneous, though he ſuffer much<br />
Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate, and<br />
not to be convinced. He flutters up and down<br />
like a Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is<br />
pruning of his Peruque takes Occaſion to con-<br />
template his Legs, and the Symmetry of his<br />
Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the<br />
Rooms, and ſerves for a walking Picture, a<br />
moving Piece of Arras. His Buſineſs is only<br />
to be ſeen, and he performs it with admirable<br />
Industry, placing himself always in the beſt<br />
Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-<br />
tious whom he mixes withal. His Occupation<br />
is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if they could but<br />
walk themselves, they would ſave him the </p>
<hr />
<p>Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.<br />
His Immunity from Varlets is his Freehold,<br />
and he were a loſt Man without it. His<br />
Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he<br />
gives him, for ’tis ten to one he never pays for<br />
them. He is very careful to diſcover the Lining<br />
of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect any<br />
Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the<br />
Skin outwards. His Taylor is his Creator,<br />
and makes him of nothing ; and though he<br />
lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_<br />
mitting Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells<br />
in the Outſide of him, like that of a hollow<br />
Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off him<br />
he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of<br />
himſelf is the wearing of his Cloaths, and,<br />
like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is better than<br />
his Body. His looking big is rather a Tumor,<br />
than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt<br />
ſo much Value, as other Men give him that<br />
believe in him, but none of his own. He<br />
makes him Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like<br />
a Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get<br />
through. He has juſt ſo much of Politics, as<br />
Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have <em>Latin</em>. He is<br />
as humble as a Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that<br />
are below him ; and with a generous Scorn<br />
deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither do him good,<br />
nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do him<br />
good, though he knows they never will ; and<br />
deſpiſes thoſe, that would not hurt him, if<br />
they could. The Court is his Church, and he<br />
believes as that believes, and cries up and down<br />
every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a<br />
great Comfort to him to think, that ſome who<br />
do not know him may perhaps take him for a<br />
Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he looks<br />
bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-<br />
tance ; and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-<br />
times know you, and ſometimes not. Nothing<br />
but want of Money or Credit puts him in<br />
mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts<br />
Providence that ſomebody will truſt him ; and<br />
in Expectation of that hopes for a better Life,<br />
and that his Debts will never riſe up in Judg-<br />
ment against him. To get in debt is to labour<br />
in his Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his<br />
Protection ; for what’s that worth to one that<br />
owes Nothing ? His Employment being only to<br />
wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his<br />
Life and Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers<br />
Books, that are his faithful Hiſtoriographers to<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes<br />
ſo much Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;<br />
and that no Man wears his Cloaths in Faſhion,<br />
that pays for them, for noting is further from<br />
the Mode. He believes that he that runs in<br />
Debt is beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,<br />
and only thoſe, that pay, are behind. His<br />
Brains are turned giddy, like one that walks<br />
on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon<br />
it is ſo troubleſome to him to look downwards.<br />
He is a Kind of Spectrum, and his Cloaths are<br />
the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ; and<br />
when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs<br />
as buſily out of one Room into another, as a<br />
great Practiſer does in <em>Weſtminſter</em>-Hall from<br />
one Court to another. When he accoſts a<br />
Lady he puts both Ends of his Microcoſm in<br />
Motion, by making Legs at one End, and<br />
combing his Peruque at the other. His Gar-<br />
niture is the Sauce to his Cloaths, and he walks<br />
in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in long<br />
Graſs. Every Motion of him crys <em>Vanity of</em><br />
<em>Vanities, all is Vanity,</em> quoth the Preacher. He<br />
rides himself like a well-managed Horſe, reins<br />
in his Neck, and walks <em>Terra Terra</em>. He<br />
carries his elbows backward, as if he were<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as<br />
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit. His Legs are<br />
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like<br />
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant<br />
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not<br />
cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long<br />
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now<br />
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover<br />
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of<br />
Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of<br />
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,<br />
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being<br />
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When he<br />
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-<br />
men do their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons<br />
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a<br />
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,<br />
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-<br />
rows from Reflection. He is as tender of his<br />
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as<br />
loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery<br />
is all his Happineſs ; and like <em>Atlas</em> he carries<br />
his Heaven on his Back. He is like the golden<br />
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He<br />
is a Monſter or an <em>Indian</em> Creature, that is<br />
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.<br />
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-<br />
dies to play upon, who when they have done<br />
with him, let down his treble-String, till they<br />
are in the Humour again. His Cook and Va-<br />
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and<br />
him ſo punctually together, that the one may<br />
not be ready before the other. As Peacocks and<br />
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,<br />
yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to flutter<br />
only. The Beggars call him <em>my Lord,</em> and he<br />
takes them at their Words, and pays them for<br />
it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-<br />
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make<br />
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-<br />
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him<br />
when you have him.<br />

ANTIQUARY</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>s one that has his Being in this Age, but<br />
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of<br />
old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-<br />
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great<br />
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like<br />
the Madman, that fell in Love with <em>Cleopatra</em>.<br />
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has<br />
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten<br />
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm<br />
in his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and<br />
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as<br />
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts. He<br />
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his<br />
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which<br />
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a<br />
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into<br />
the World. He ſpends the one half of his<br />
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes<br />
ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does<br />
it, the further they are from being new to him.<br />
All his Curiouſities take place of one another<br />
according to their Seniority, and he values<br />
them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.<br />
He has a great Veneration for Words that are<br />
ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that<br />
they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe<br />
he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-<br />
tiquity, and the good Services they have done.<br />
He throws away his Time in enquiring after<br />
that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,<br />
like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find<br />
out another that was loſt before. He fetches<br />
things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable<br />
of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own<br />
Aſhes. He values one old Invention, that is<br />
loſt and never to be recovered, before all the<br />
new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.<br />
The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with<br />
his, that ſhows the Tombs at <em>Westminster</em>, only<br />
the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other<br />
for Money. As every Man has but one Fa-<br />
ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World<br />
of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>for Things that are antient, and the further off<br />
the greater.</p>
<p>He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time<br />
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,<br />
but is wholly retied from the preſent. His<br />
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came<br />
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is<br />
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of<br />
them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to<br />
any Thing that is old, that he may truly <em>ſay to</em><br />
<em>Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-</em><br />
<em>tenneſs thou are my Mother</em>. He has no Provi-<br />
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-<br />
tions look backward upon the Days of old,<br />
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he<br />
walked backwards. He had rather interpret<br />
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-<br />
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious<br />
new one ; and with <em>Scaliger</em> would ſell the<br />
Empire of <em>Germany</em>[^1] (if it were in his Power)<br />
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-<br />
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths<br />
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>it above any Thing printed, which he accounts<br />
but a Novelty. When he happens to cure a<br />
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud<br />
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,<br />
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.<br />
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-<br />
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are<br />
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the<br />
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds<br />
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they<br />
are made up. He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch<br />
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince<br />
out of Uſe ; as the <em>Catholics</em> allow of no Saints,<br />
but ſuch as are dead, and the <em>Fanatics</em>, Op-<br />
poſition, of none but the Living.<br />

<br />
[<em>two line initial</em>]HAS taken his Degree in Cheating, and<br />
[<em>two line initial</em>] the higheſt of his Faculty ; or paid for<br />
refuſing his <em>MANDAMUS</em>. He is a Peer of the<br />
City, and a Member of their upper Houſe,<br />
Who, as ſoon as he arrives at ſo many thouſand<br />
Pounds, is bound by the Charter to ſerve the<br />
Public with ſo much Underſtanding, what<br />
ſhift ſoever he make to raiſe it, and wear a<br />
Chain about his Neck like a Raindeer, or in<br />
Default to commute, and make Satisfaction in<br />
ready Money, the beſt Reaſon of the Place;<br />
for which hi has the Name only, like a titular<br />
Prince, and is an <em>Alderman extraordinary</em>. But<br />
if his Wife can prevail with him to ſtand, he<br />
becomes one of the City-ſupporters, and, like<br />
the Unicorn in the King's Arms, wears a Chain<br />
about his Neck very right-worſhipfully. He<br />
wears Scarlet, as the Whore of <em>Babylon</em> does,<br />
not for her honeſty, but the Rank and Quality<br />
<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>ſhe is of among the Wicked, When he ſits as a Judge in his Court he is abſolute, and uſes arbitrary Power ; for he is not bound to un- derſtand what he does, nor render an Account why he gives Judgment on one Side rather than another ; but his Will is ſufficient to ſtand for his Reaſon, to all Intents and Purpoſes. He does no public Buſineſs without eating and drinking, and never meets about Matters of Im- portance, but the Cramming his Inſide is the moſt weighty Part of the Work of the Day. He diſpatches no public Affair until he has thoroughly dined upon it, and is fully ſatisfied with Quince-Pye and Cuſtard : for Men are wiſer, the <em>Italians</em> ſay, after their Bellies are full, than when they are faſting, and he is very cautious to omit no Occaſion of improving his Parts that Way. He is ſo careful of the In- tereſt of his Belly, and manages it ſo induſ- triouſly, that in a little Space it grows great and takes Place of all the reſt of his Members, and becomes ſo powerful, that they will never be in a Condition to rebel againſt it any more. He is cloathed in Scarlet the Livery of his Sins, like the rich Glutton, to put him in Mind of what Means he came to his Wealth and Pre- ferment by. He makes a Trade of his Eat-</p>
<hr />
<p>This is Sarah testing testing testing</p>
<hr />
<p>ing, and, like a Cock, ſcrapes when he feeds; for the Public pays for all and more, which he and his Brethren ſhare among themſelves ; for they never make a dry Reckoning. When he comes to be Lord-Mayor he does not keep a great Houſe, but a very great Houſe-warming for a whole Year ; for though he invites all the <em>Companies</em> in the City he does not treat them, but they club to entertain him, and pay the Reckoning beforehand. His Fur-gown makes him look a great deal bigger than he is, like the Feathers of an Owl, and when he pulls it off, he looks as if he were fallen away, or like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.</p>
