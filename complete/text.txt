PREFACE.


_T²HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit_
_much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt_
_Century. The two principal Authors in this Way_
_were Sir_ Thomas Overbury, _and Dr._ John
Earle _Tutor to Prince_ Charles _in_ 1643, _and after_
_the Reſtoration Dean of_ Weſtminſter, _and ſuc-_
_ceſſively Biſhop of_ Worceſter _and_ Saliſbury. _How_
_agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public_
_Taſte may be judged from Sir_ Thomas’s _little Book_
_having fourteen Editions before_ 1632, _and the_
_Biſhop’s ſix between_ 1628 _and_ 1633. _Whether_
Butler _has equalled or excelled them, and what_
_Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt_
_be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-_
_reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me_
_a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge. The Reader_
_will have an Opportunity of determining for him-_
_ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame_
_Pictures._

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_As in ſuch a Variety of Characters there muſt_
_be ſome drawn from Originals in general the ſame,_
_and only differenced by particular Circumſtances,_
_the ſame Obſervations are ſometimes repeated._
_Whether the Author in this Caſe requires any Apo-_
_logy muſt be left to his Judges the Critics ; it is_
_enough for me that I can ſay I have done him_
_Justice in publiſhing them._

_As moſt of theſe Characters are dated when they_
_were compoſed, I can inform the curious, that they_
_were chiefly drawn up from_ 1667 _to_ 1669, _at_
_which time, as has been before obſerved,_ Butler
_reſided in_ Wales _under the Protection of Lord_
Carbery.

A
HUFFING COURTIER


I²S a Cypher, that has no Value himſelf, but
from the Place he ſtands in. All his Hap-
pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others
have of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-
retical and erroneous, though he ſuffer much
Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate, and
not to be convinced. He flutters up and down
like a Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is
pruning of his Peruque takes Occaſion to con-
template his Legs, and the Symmetry of his
Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the
Rooms, and ſerves for a walking Picture, a
moving Piece of Arras. His Buſineſs is only
to be ſeen, and he performs it with admirable
Industry, placing himself always in the beſt
Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-
tious whom he mixes withal. His Occupation
is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if they could but
walk themselves, they would ſave him the 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.
His Immunity from Varlets is his Freehold,
and he were a loſt Man without it. His
Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he
gives him, for ’tis ten to one he never pays for
them. He is very careful to diſcover the Lining
of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect any
Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the
Skin outwards. His Taylor is his Creator,
and makes him of nothing ; and though he
lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_
mitting Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells
in the Outſide of him, like that of a hollow
Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off him
he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of
himſelf is the wearing of his Cloaths, and,
like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is better than
his Body. His looking big is rather a Tumor,
than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt
ſo much Value, as other Men give him that
believe in him, but none of his own. He
makes him Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like
a Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get
through. He has juſt ſo much of Politics, as
Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have _Latin_. He is
as humble as a Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that
are below him ; and with a generous Scorn
deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither do him good,
nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do him
good, though he knows they never will ; and
deſpiſes thoſe, that would not hurt him, if
they could. The Court is his Church, and he
believes as that believes, and cries up and down
every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a
great Comfort to him to think, that ſome who
do not know him may perhaps take him for a
Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he looks
bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-
tance ; and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-
times know you, and ſometimes not. Nothing
but want of Money or Credit puts him in
mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts
Providence that ſomebody will truſt him ; and
in Expectation of that hopes for a better Life,
and that his Debts will never riſe up in Judg-
ment against him. To get in debt is to labour
in his Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his
Protection ; for what’s that worth to one that
owes Nothing ? His Employment being only to
wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his
Life and Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers
Books, that are his faithful Hiſtoriographers to

------------------------------------------------------------------------

their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes
ſo much Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;
and that no Man wears his Cloaths in Faſhion,
that pays for them, for noting is further from
the Mode. He believes that he that runs in
Debt is beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,
and only thoſe, that pay, are behind. His
Brains are turned giddy, like one that walks
on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon
it is ſo troubleſome to him to look downwards.
He is a Kind of Spectrum, and his Cloaths are
the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ; and
when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs
as buſily out of one Room into another, as a
great Practiſer does in _Weſtminſter_-Hall from
one Court to another. When he accoſts a
Lady he puts both Ends of his Microcoſm in
Motion, by making Legs at one End, and
combing his Peruque at the other. His Gar-
niture is the Sauce to his Cloaths, and he walks
in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in long
Graſs. Every Motion of him crys _Vanity of_
_Vanities, all is Vanity,_ quoth the Preacher. He
rides himself like a well-managed Horſe, reins
in his Neck, and walks _Terra Terra_. He
carries his elbows backward, as if he were

------------------------------------------------------------------------

pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit. His Legs are
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not
cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of
Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When he
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-
men do their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-
rows from Reflection. He is as tender of his
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as
loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery
is all his Happineſs ; and like _Atlas_ he carries
his Heaven on his Back. He is like the golden
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He
is a Monſter or an _Indian_ Creature, that is
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle

------------------------------------------------------------------------

in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-
dies to play upon, who when they have done
with him, let down his treble-String, till they
are in the Humour again. His Cook and Va-
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and
him ſo punctually together, that the one may
not be ready before the other. As Peacocks and
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,
yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to flutter
only. The Beggars call him _my Lord,_ and he
takes them at their Words, and pays them for
it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him
when you have him.

AN
ANTIQUARY


I²S one that has his Being in this Age, but
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of
old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like
the Madman, that fell in Love with _Cleopatra_.
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm
in his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts. He
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into
the World. He ſpends the one half of his
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes
ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does
it, the further they are from being new to him.
All his Curiouſities take place of one another
according to their Seniority, and he values
them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.
He has a great Veneration for Words that are
ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that
they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe
he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-
tiquity, and the good Services they have done.
He throws away his Time in enquiring after
that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,
like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find
out another that was loſt before. He fetches
things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable
of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own
Aſhes. He values one old Invention, that is
loſt and never to be recovered, before all the
new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.
The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with
his, that ſhows the Tombs at _Westminster_, only
the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other
for Money. As every Man has but one Fa-
ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World
of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value

------------------------------------------------------------------------

for Things that are antient, and the further off
the greater.

He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,
but is wholly retied from the preſent. His
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of
them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to
any Thing that is old, that he may truly _ſay to_
_Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-_
_tenneſs thou are my Mother_. He has no Provi-
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-
tions look backward upon the Days of old,
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he
walked backwards. He had rather interpret
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious
new one ; and with _Scaliger_ would ſell the
Empire of _Germany_[1] (if it were in his Power)
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values

------------------------------------------------------------------------

it above any Thing printed, which he accounts
but a Novelty. When he happens to cure a
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they
are made up. He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince
out of Uſe ; as the _Catholics_ allow of no Saints,
but ſuch as are dead, and the _Fanatics_, Op-
poſition, of none but the Living.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A
PROUD MAN


I²S a Fool in Fermentation, that ſwells and
boils over like a Porridge-Pot. He ſets out
his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem
bigger than he is. He is troubled with a Tu-
mour and Inflammation of Self-Conceit, that
renders every Part of him ſtiff and uneaſy.
He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-
der, that works upon him to Dotage, and has
transformed him into his own Miſtreſs. He
is his own Gallant, and makes moſt paſſionate
Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections. He
commits Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips
his own Image ; though there is no Soul living
of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes as
the Church believes, and maintains his Faith
with the Obſtinacy of a _Fanatic._ He is his own
Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above
his Merit, but all Mankind ; is both _Damon_
and _Pythias_ to his own dear ſelf, and values his

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crony above his Soul. He gives Place to no
Man but himſelf, and that with very great
Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems not
worthy to approach him. He believes what-
ſoever he has receives a Value in being his ;
as a Horſe in a Nobleman’s Stable will bear a
greater Price than in a common Market. He
is ſo proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted
with himſelf as with others ; for he is very
apt to forget who he is, and knows himſelf
only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats himſelf
civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and Com-
pliment, but admits of no Privacy. He ſtrives
to look bigger than himſelf, as well as others,
and is no better than his own Paraſite and
Flatterer. A little Flood will make a ſhallow
Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and
foam, and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep
ſilent Stream glides quietly on. So a vain-
glorious inſolent proud Man ſwells with a little
frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-
flows his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves
Mud and Dirt behind him. His Carriage is
as glorious and haughty, as if he were advan-
ced upon Men’s Shoulders, or tumbled over
their Heads like Knipperdolling. He fancies 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head
holds no Proportion to his Body, and his foun-
dation is leſſer than his upper Stories. We
can naturally take no view of our ſelves, un-
leſs we look downwards, to teach us how
humble Admirers we ought to be of our own
Values. The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his Mate-
rials are, the more Room they take up, and
make him ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and
Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions better than Things
of more cloſe and ſolid Parts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A
FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN


I²S one, that is not contented to be a Privy-
Counſellor of the Kingdom of Heaven, but
would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,
and tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the
Kingdom of Earth. His Deſign is to make
_Chriſt_ King, as his Forefathers the _Jew_ did,
only to abuſe and crucify him, that he might
ſhare his Lands and Goods, as he did his Vice-
gerents here. He dreams of a Fool's Paradiſe
without a Serpent in it, a golden Age all of
Saints, and no Hypocrites, all _holy-Court_ Princes,
and no Subjects but the Wicked ; a Govern-
ment of _Perkin Warbec_ and _Lambert Simnel_
Saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it,
might make himſelf a Price, and claim a
Title to the Crown. He fancies a _fifth-Mo-_
_narchy_ as the Quinteſſence of all Governments,
abſtracted from all Matter, and conſiſting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and Myſteries.
_John_ of _Leyden_ was the firſt Founder of it, and
though he miſcarried, like _Romulus_ in a Tem-
peſt, his Poſterity have Revelations every full
Moon, that there may be a Time to ſet up his
Title again, and with better Succeſs ; though
his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had
no ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,
but their whole outward Men were ſet on the
Gates of the City ; where a Head and four
Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of the
_fifth-Monarchy._ They have been contriving (ſince
Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-
ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed King
_Oberon,_ to erect their Monarchy in _Fairy-Land,_
as being the moſt proper and natural Region in
the whole World for their Government, and if
it ſucceed there to proceed further. The _De-_
_vil's_ Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,
and the Glory of them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,
that they would venture their Necks to take
him at his Word, and give him his Price.
Nothing comes ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-
neſs as the _fifth-Monarchy,_ that is no where to
be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-
thologies, and myſtical Riddles, like the Vi-
ſions _Aeneas_ ſaw in Hell of the _Roman_ Empire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next this it moſt reſembles _Mahomet_’s Coming
to the _Turks,_ and King _Arthur_’s Reign over the
Britons in _Merlin_’s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin
are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern
the ſame Lineaments in them all. The poor
Wicked are like to have a very ill time under
them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-
vernment, according to their ancient and fun-
damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects
but Slaves, who between them and the _Devil_
are like to ſuffer Perſecution enough to make
them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-
ters. He gathers Churches on the Sunday, as
the _Jews_ did Sticks on their Sabbath, to ſet the
State on Fire. He humms and hahs high Trea-
ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the
Caſt they would throw. He groans Sedition,
and, like the _Phariſee,_ rails, when he gives
Thanks. He interprets Propheſies, as _Whitting-
ton_ did the Bells, to ſpeak to him, and governs
himſelf accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[_two rules_]



THE
HENPECT MAN


R²IDES behind his Wife, and lets her
wear the Spurs and governs the Reins. He
is a Kind of prepoſterous Animal, that being
curbed in goes with his Tail forwards. He is
but ſubordinate and miniſterial to his Wife,
who commands in chief, and he dares do no-
thing without her Order. She takes Place of him,
and he creeps in at the Bed’s Feet, as if he had
married the _Grand Seignor_’s Daughter, and is
under Correction of her Pantofle. He is his
Wife’s Villain, and has nothing of his own
further than ſhe pleaſes to allow him. When
he was married he promiſed to worſhip his
Wife with his Soul inſtead of his Body, and
endowed her among his worldly Goods with his
Humanity. He changed Sexes with his Wife,
and put off the old Man to put on the new
Woman. She ſits as the Helm, and he does
but tug like a Slave at the Oar. The little

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wit he has being held _in capite_ has rendered all
the reſt of his Concerments liable to Pupi-
lage and Wardſhip, and his Wife has the
Tuition of his during his or her Life ; and
he has no Power to do any Thing of himſelf,
but by his Guardian. His Wife manages him
and his Eſtate with equal Authority, and he
lives unde rher aribtrary Government and Com-
mand as his ſuperior Office. He is but a kind
of Meſſuage and Tenement in the Occupation
of his Wife. He and ſhe make up a Kind of
Hermaphrodite, a Monſter, or which the one
half is more than the whole ; for he is the
weaker Veſſel, and but his Wife's Helper. His
Wife eſpouſed and took him to Huſband for
better or worſe, and the laſt Word ſtands.
He was meant to be his Wife's Head, but being
ſet on at the wrong End ſhe makes him ſerve
(like the Jeſuits Devil) for her Feet. He is her
Province, an Acquiſition that ſhe took in,
and gives Laws to at Indiſcretion ; for being
overmatched and too feeble for the Encounter,
he was forced to ſubmit and take Quarter.
He has inverted the Curſe, and turned it upon
himſelf ; for his Deſire is towards his Wife,
and ſhe reign over him, and with _Eſau_ has
ſold his Birthright for a Meſs of Matrimony.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

His Wife took his Liberty among his worldly
Goods, to have and to hold till Death them
do part. He is but Groom of his Wife’s
Chamber, and her menial Huſband, that is
always in waiting, and a Slave only in the Right
of his Wife.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[_double rule_]



A
SMALL POET


I²S one, that would fain make himſelf that,
which _Nature_ never meant him ; like a _Fa-_
_natic_, that inſpires himſelf with his own
Whimſies. He ſets up Haberdaſher of ſmall
Poetry, with a very ſmall Stock, and no Credit.
He believes it is Invention enough to find out
other Men’s Wit ; and whatſoever he lights upon
either in Books, or Company, he makes bold
with as his own. This he puts together ſo un-
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit
has the Rickets, by the ſwelling Diſproportion
of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of
him ; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that
he has catched of others ; and his Flame like
that of Charcoals, that were burnt before :
But as he wants Judgment to underſtand what
is beſt, he naturally takes the worſt, as being
moſt agreeable to his own Talent. You may

------------------------------------------------------------------------

know his Wit not to be natural, ’tis ſo un-
quiet and troubleſome in him : For as thoſe,
that have Money but ſeldom, are always ſhak-
ing their Pockets, when they have it ; ſo does
he, when he thinks he has got ſomething, that
will make him appear. He is a perpetual Tal-
ker ; and you may know by the Freedom of his
Diſcourſe, that he came light by it, as Thieves
ſpend freely what they get. He meaſures other
Men’s Wits by _their_ Modeſty, and his own by
_his_ Confidence. He makes nothing of writing
Plays, becauſe he has not Wit enough to un-
derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-
ture to talk and ſcribble, as Chowſes do to play
with cunning Gameſters, until they are cheated
and laughed at. He is always talking of Wit,
as thoſe, that have bad Voices, are always ſing-
ing out of Tune ; and thoſe, that cannot play,
delight to fumble on Inſtruments. He grows
the unwiſer by other Men’s Harms ; for the
worſe others write, he finds the more Encou-
ragement to do ſo too. His Greedineſs of
Praiſe is ſo eager, that he ſwallows any Thing,
that comes in the Likeneſs of it, how notorious
and palpable ſoever, and is as Shot-free againſt
any Thing, that may leſſen his good Opinion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

of himſelf---This renders him incurable, like
Diſeaſes, that grow inſenſible.

If you diſlike him it is at your own Peril ;
he is ſure to put in a Caveat beforehand againſt
your Understanding ; and, like a Malefactor
in Wit, is always furniſhed with Exceptions
againſt his Judges. This puts him upon perpe-
tual Apologies, Excuſes, and Defences, but
ſtill by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-
fling Strain, without Regard of any Man,
that ſtands in the Way of his Pageant.
Where he thinks he may do it ſafely, he
will confidently own other Men’s Writings ;
and where he fears the Truth may be diſcovered,
he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inſinua-
tions give Men Occaſion to ſuppoſe ſo.

If he underſtands _Latin_ or _Greek_ he ranks
himſelf among the Learned, deſpiſes the Igno-
rant, talks Criticiſms out of _Scaliger_, and re-
peats _Martial_'s baudy Epigrams, and ſets up
his Reſt wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be
not ſo well qualified, he crys down all Learning
as pedantic, diſclaims Study, and profeſſes to
write with as great Facility, as if his Muſe was

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ſliding down _Parnaſſus_. Whatſoever he hears
well ſaid[2] he ſeizes upon by poetical Licence ;
and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill
repeating of it---This he believes to be no
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others
throw away. By this means his Writings are,
like a Taylor’s Cuſhion, of moſaic Work,
made up of ſeveral Scraps ſewed together.
He calls a ſlovenly naſty Deſcription _great Na-_
_ture_, and dull Flatneſs _strange Eaſineſs_. He
writes down all that comes in his Head, and
makes no Choice, becauſe he has nothing to
do it with, that is Judgment. He is always
repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like
the _long Parliament_ making _Ordinances_ in their
Stead ; although they are perpetually _thrown_
_out_ of Coffee-Houſes, and come to Nothing.
He is like an _Italian_ Thief, that never robs,
but he murthers, to prevent Diſcovery ; ſo ſure
is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur-
loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may paſs
unſuſpected. He is but a Copier at beſt, and
will never arrive to practice by the Life : For
bar him the Imitation of ſomething he has
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form
of juſt Wit, are above his Philoſophy. He
appears ſo over concerned in all Men’s Wits,
as if they were but Diſparagements of his
own ; and crys down all they do, as if they
were Encroachments upon him. He takes
Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them, as
_Justices_ do falſe Weights, and Pots that want
Meaſure. When he meets with any Thing,
that is very good, he changes it into ſmall
Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to
ſerve ſeveral Occaſions. He diſclaims Study,
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to ſhoot
flying, which appears to be very true by his
often miſſing of his Mark. His Wit is much
troubled with Obſtructions ; and he has Fits as
painful as thoſe of the Spleen. He fancies him-
ſelf a dainty ſpruce Shepherd, with a Flock and
a fine ſilken Shepherdeſs, that follows his Pipe,
as Rats did the Conjurers in _Germany_.

As for _Epithets_, he always avoids thoſe, that
are near akin to the Senſse. Such matches are
unlawful, and not fit to be made by a _Chriſtian_
Poet ; and therefore all his Care is to chuſe out
[^2]: [_footnote cont'd from prev. page_] _Quem recitas meus eſt, O
Fidentine, libellus :_
_Sed male dum recitas, incipit eſſe tuus.    Mart. L. 1. Ep. 39._

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ſuch, as will ſerve, like a wooden Leg, to piece
out a main’d Verſe, that wants a Foot or two ;
and if they will but rhimes now and then into
the Bargain, or run upon a Letter, it is a Work
of Supererrogation.

For _Similitudes_, he likes the hardeſt and moſt
obſcure beſt : For as Ladies wear black Patches,
to make their Complexions ſeem fairer than
they are ; ſo when an Illuſtration is more ob-
ſcure than the Senſe that went before it, it muſt
of Neceſſity make it appear clearer than it
did : For Contraries are beſt ſet off with Con-
traries.

He has found out a Way to ſave the Expence
of much Wit and Senſe : For he will make
leſs than ſome have prodigally laid out upon
five or ſix Words ſerve forty or fifty Lines.
This is a thrifty Invention, and very eaſy ; and,
if it were commonly known, would much in-
creaſe the Trade of Wit, and maintain a Mul-

He has found out a new Sort of poetical _Geor-_
_gics_, a Trick of ſowing Wit like clover-graſs
on barren Subjects, which would yield nothing
before. This is very uſeful for the Times,
wherein, ſome Men ſay, there is no Room left
for new Invention. He will take three Grains
of Wit like the Elixir, and projecting it upon
the _Iron-Age_ turn it immediately into _Gold---_
All the Buſineſs of Mankind has preſently
vaniſhed, the whole World has kept Holiday ;
there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets,
no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdeſſes ;
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed
Plum-Porrige.

We read that _Virgil_ uſed to make[3] fifty or
ſixty Verſes in a Morning, and afterwards re-
duce them to ten. This was an unthrifty
Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the
Huſbandry of his own Poetry, as _Seneca_ ſays
he was in that of a Farm ;[4] for in plain _Engliſh_

------------------------------------------------------------------------

it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine-
pence. And as ſuch Courſes brought the
_prodigal Son_ to eat with Hogs : So they did him
to feed with Horſes,[5] which were not much
better Company, and may teach us to avoid
doing the like. For certainly it is more noble
to take four or five Grains of Senſe, and, like
a Gold-Beater, hammer them into ſo many
Leaves as will fill a whole Book ; than to write
nothing but Epitomies, which many wiſe Men
believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.

When he writes, he commonly ſteers the
Senſe of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the
End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the
Tail. For when he has made one Line, which
is eaſy enough ; and has found out ſome ſturdy
hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham-
mer the Senſe upon it, like a Piece of hot Iron
upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleaſes.

There is no Art in the World ſo rich in
Terms as Poetry ; a whole Dictionary is ſcarce

------------------------------------------------------------------------

able to contain them : For there is hardly a
Pond, a Sheep-walk, or a Gravel-pit in all
_Greece_, but the antient Name of it is become
a Term of Art in Poetry. By this means ſmall
Poets have ſuch a Stock of able hard Words lying
by them, as _Dryades_, _Hamadryades_, _Aonides_, _Fauni_,
_Nymphae_, _Sylvani_, _&c_. that ſignify nothing at all ;
and ſuch a World of pedantic Terms of the
ſame Kind, as may ſerve to furniſh all the new
Inventions and _thorough-Reformations_, that can
happen between this and _Plato_’s great Year.

When he writes he never propoſes any Scope
or Purpoſe to himſelf, but gives his Genius all
Freedom : For as he, that rides abroad for his
Pleaſure, can hardly be out of his Way ; ſo he
that writes for his Pleaſure, can ſeldom be be-
ſide his Subject. It is an ungrateful Thing to
a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing---
To what Purpoſe did the Antients feign _Pegaſus_
to have Wings, if he muſt be confined to the
Road and Stages like a Pack-Horſe, or be forced
to be obedient to Hedges and Ditches? There-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

fore he has no Reſpect to Decorum and Pro-
priety of Circumſtance ; for the Regard of
Perſons, Times, and Places is a Reſtraint too
ſervile to be impoſed upon poetical Licence ;
like him that made _Plato_[6] confeſs _Juvenal_ to be
a Philoſopher, or _Perſius_, that calls the _Athe_-
_nians Quirites_.

For _Metaphors_, he uſes to chuſe the hardeſt,
and moſt far-fet that he can light upon---Theſe
are the Jewels of Eloquence, and therefore the
harder they are, the more precious they muſt
be.

He’ll take ſcant Piece of coarſe Senſe, and
ſtretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a ſcore
Rhimes, until it crack that you may ſee through
it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head. When
you ſee his Verſes hanged up in Tobacco-Shops,
you may ſay, in defiance of the Proverb, _that_
_the weakeſt does not always go to the Wall_ ; for ’tis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

well known the Lines are ſtrong enough, and
in that Senſe may juſtly take the Wall of any,
that have been written in our Language. He
ſeldom makes a Conſcience of his Rhimes ; but
will often take the Liberty to make _preach_
rhime with _Cheat_, _Vote_ with _Rogue_, and _Com_-
_mittee-Man_ with _Hang_.

He’ll make one Word of as many Joints, as
the Tin-Pudding, that a Jugler pulls out of
his Throat, and chops in again---What think
you of _glud-fum-flam-hasta-minantes ?_ Some of
the old _Latin_ Poets[7] bragged, that their Verſes
were tougher than Braſs, and harder than
Marble ; what would they have done, if they
had ſeen theſe ? Verily they would have had
more reaſon to wiſh themſelves an hundred
Throats, than they then had, to pronounce them.

believes all Religion conſiſts in Looſeneſs, and that Sin and Vice is
_the whole Duty of Man_. He puts off the _old Man_, but puts it on again
upon the _new one,_ and makes his _Pagan_ Vices ſerve to preſerve his
_Chriſtian_ Virtues from wearing out ; for if he ſhould uſe his Piety

that Iniquity and Vice ſhould be thrown away, as long as there may be
good Uſe of it ; for if that, which is wickedly gotten, may be diſposed
to pious Uſes, why ſhould not Wickedneſs itſelf as well? He believes
himſelf Shot-free againſt all the Attempts of the _Devil,_ the _World,_

Quarters, and encounter them at their own Weapons.

ſelves, which would deſtroy thoſe that are

Brother, and yet come off never the worſe.

Sins that are committed in private, not thoſe
that are acted openly and owned. He is but

for, as the one wears his Vices within, and
the other without, ſo when they are counter-
changed the _Ranter_ becomes an _Hypocrite,_ and
the _Hypocrite_ an able _Ranter._ His Church is
the _Devil's_ Chappel ; for it agrees exactly both

pleaſes ; yet is a great Enemy to arbitrary
Power, becauſe he would have no Body uſe it

he makes all the Law run on the King's Side ;
if not, it always takes part againſt him ; for as
he was bred to make any Thing right or wrong
between Man and Man, ſo he can do between

Proceedings of State, without the punctual
Formality of Law, arbitrary and illegal, but

derſtand what he does, nor render an Account
why he gives Judgment on one Side rather
than another ; but his Will is ſufficient to ſtand
for his Reaſon, to all Intents and Purpoſes.
He does no public Buſineſs without eating and
drinking, and never meets about Matters of Im-
portance, but the Cramming his Inſide is the
moſt weighty Part of the Work of the Day.
He diſpatches no public Affair until he has
thoroughly dined upon it, and is fully ſatisfied
with Quince-Pye and Cuſtard : for Men are
wiſer, the _Italians_ ſay, after their Bellies are
full, than when they are faſting, and he is very
cautious to omit no Occaſion of improving his
Parts that Way. He is ſo careful of the In-
tereſt of his Belly, and manages it ſo induſ-
triouſly, that in a little Space it grows great
and takes Place of all the reſt of his Members,
and becomes ſo powerful, that they will never
be in a Condition to rebel againſt it any more.
He is cloathed in Scarlet the Livery of his Sins,
like the rich Glutton, to put him in Mind of
what Means he came to his Wealth and Pre-
ferment by. He makes a Trade of his Eat-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ing, and, like a Cock, ſcrapes when he feeds ;
for the Public pays for all and more, which he
and his Brethren ſhare among themſelves ; for
they never make a dry Reckoning. When he
comes to be Lord-Mayor he does not keep a
great Houſe, but a very great Houſe-warming
for a whole Year ; for though he invites all the
_Companies_ in the City he does not treat them,
but they club to entertain him, and pay the
Reckoning beforehand. His Fur-gown makes
him look a great deal bigger than he is, like
the Feathers of an Owl, and when he pulls
it off, he looks as if he were fallen away, or
like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.

A
QUAKER


I²S a Scoundrel Saint, of an Order without
Founder, Vow, or Rule ; for he will not
ſwear, nor be tyed to any Thing, but his own
Humour. He is the Link-Boy of the Sectaries,
and talks much of his Light, but puts it under
a Buſhel, for nobody can ſee it but himſelf. His
Religion is but the cold Fit of an Ague, and his
Zeal of a contrary Temper to that of all others,
yet produces the ſame Effects ; as cold Iron in
_Greenland_, they ſay, burns as well as hot ;
which makes him delight, like a Salamander,
to live in the Fire of Perſecution. He works
out his Salvation, not with _Fear_, but _Confidence_
_and Trembling_. His Profeſſion is but a Kind
of Winter-Religion ; and the Original of it as
uncertain as the hatching of Woodcocks, for
no Man can tell from whence it came. He
Vapours much of the Light within him, but
no ſuch Thing appears, unleſs he means as he

------------------------------------------------------------------------

is light-headed. He believes he takes up the
Croſs in being croſs to all Mankind. He de_
lights in Perſecution, as ſome old extravagant
Fornicators find a Lechery in being whipt ;
and has no Ambition but to go to Heaven in
what he calls a fiery Chariot, that is, a Wood-
monger’s Faggot Cart. You may perceive he
has a Crack in his Skill by the flat Twang of
his Noſe, and the great Care he takes to keep
his Hat on, leſt his ſickly Brains, if he have
any, ſhould take Cold at it. He believes his
Doctrine to be heavenly, becauſe it agrees per-
fectly with the _Motus Trepidationis_. All his
Hopes are in the _Turks_ overrunning of Chriſ-
tendom, becauſe he has heard they count Fools
and Madmen Saints, and doubts not to paſs
muſter with them for great Abilities that Way.
This makes him believe he can convert the _Turk_,
tho’ he could do no good on the _Pope_, or the
_Preſbyterian_. Nothing comes ſo near his quak-
ing Liturgy, as the Papiſtical Poſſeſſions of the
_Devil_, with which it conforms in Diſcipline
exact. His Church, or rather Chapel, is built
upon a flat Sand, without ſuperior or inferior
in it, and not upon a Rock, which is never
found without great Inequalities. Next De_
moniacs he moſt reſembles the Reprobate, who

------------------------------------------------------------------------

are ſaid to be condemned to Weeping and
Gnaſhing of Teeth. There was a Botcher of
their Church, that renounced his Trade and
turned Preacher, becauſe he held it ſuperſtiti-
ous to ſit _croſs-legged_. His Devotion is but a
Kind of ſpiritual Palſy, that proceeds from a
Diſtemper in the Brain, where the Nerves are
rooted. They abhor the Church of _England_,
but conform exactly with thoſe primitive Fa-
theres of their Church, that heretofore gave An-
ſwers at the _Devil_’s Oracles, in which they ob-
ſerved the very ſame Ceremony of quaking and
and gaping now practiſed by our modern En_
thuſiaſts at their Exorciſms, rather than Ex-
erciſes of Devotion. He ſucks in the Air like
a Pair of Bellows, and blows his inward Light
with it, till he dung Fire, as Cattle do in _Lin_-
_colnſhire_. The general Ignorance of their
whole Party make it appear, that whatſoever
their Zeal may be, it is not _according to Know_-
_ledge_.

A
VINTNER


H²ANGS out his Buſh to ſhew he has not
good Wine ; for that, the Proverb ſays, needs it not. If wine were as
neceſſary as
Bread, he would ſtand in the Pillory for ſelling
falſe Meaſure, as well as Bakers do for falſe
Weight ; but ſince it is at every Man’s Choice
to come to his Houſe or not, thoſe that do, are
guilty of half the Injuries he does them, and
he believes the reſt to be none at all, becauſe
no Injury can be done to him, that is willing
to take it. He had rather ſell bad Wine, than
good that ſtands him in no more, for it makes
Men ſooner drunk, and then they are the eaſier
over-reckoned. By the Knaveries he acts
above-board, which every Man ſees, one may
eaſily take a Meaſure of thoſe he does under
Ground in his Cellar ; for he that will pick
a Man’s Pocket to his Face, will not ſtick to
uſe him worſe in private when he knows no-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

thing of it. When he has poiſoned his
Wines he raiſes his Price, and to make amends
for that abates his Meaſure, for he thinks it
a greater Sin to commit Murder for ſmall
Gains, than a valuable Conſideration. He
does not only ſpoil and deſtroy his Wines, but
an ancient reverend Proverb, with brewing and
racking, that ſays, _In vino veritas_, for there
is no Truth in his, but all falſe and ſophiſtica-
ted ; for he can counterfeit Wine as cunningly
as _Apelles_ did Grapes, and cheat Men with it,
as _he_ did Birds. He brings every Bottle of
Wine he draws to the _Bar_, to confeſs it to be
a Cheat, and afterwards puts himſelf upon
the Mercy of the Company. He is an _Anti-_
_chriſtian_ Cheat ; for Chriſt turned Water into
Wine, and he turns Wine into Water. He
ſcores all his Reckonings upon two Tables
made like thoſe of the ten Commandments, that
he may be put in Mind to break them as oft as
poſſibly he can ; eſpecially that of ſtealing and
bearing falſe Witneſs againſt his Neighbour,
when he draws him bad Wine and ſwears it is
good, and that he can take more for the Pipe
than the Wine will yield him by the Bottle,
a Trick that a _Jesuit_ taught him to cheat his

------------------------------------------------------------------------

own Conſcience with. When he is found to
over-reckon notoriouſly, he has one common
Evaſion for all, and that is to ſay it was a
Miſtake, by which he means, that he thought
they had not been ſober enough to diſcover it ;
for if it had paſt, there had been no Error at
all in the Caſe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A
LOVER


I²S a Kind of _Goth_ and _Vandal_, that leaves
his native Self to ſettle in another, or a
Planter that forſakes his Country, where he
was born, to labour and dig in _Virginia_.
His Heart is catched in a Net with a Pair of
bringht ſhining Eyes, as Larks are with Pieces
of a looking-Glaſs. He makes heavy Com_
plaints againſt it for deſerting of him, and
deſires to have another in Exchange for it,
which is a very unreaſonable Requeſt ; for if
it betrayed its boſom Friend, what will it do
to a Stranger, that ſhould give it Truſt and
Entertainment ? He binds himſelf, and cries
out he is robbed of his Heart, and charges the
Innocent with it, only to get a good Com-
poſition, or another for it, againſt Con-
ſcience and Honeſty. He talks much of his

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flame, and pretends to be burnt by his Miſ-
treſs’s Eyes, for which he requires Satisfaction
from her, like one that ſets his Houſe on Fire
to get a Brief for charitable Contributions.
He makes his Miſtreſs all of Stars, and when
ſhe is unkind, rails at them, as if they did ill
Offices between them, and being of her Kin
ſet her againſt him. He falls in Love as Men
fall ſick when their Bodies are inclined to it,
and imputes that to his Miſtreſſes Charms,
which is really in his own Temper ; for when
that is altered, the other vaniſhes of it ſelf, and
therefore one ſaid not amiſs,

------The Lilly and the Roſe
Not in her Cheeks, but in thy Temper grows.

When his Deſires are grown up, they ſwarm,
and fly out to ſeek a new Habitation, and
whereſoever they light they fix like Bees, among
which ſome late Philoſophers have obſerved
that it is a Female that leads all the reſt. Love
is but a Clap of the Mind, a Kind of run-
ning of the Fancy, that breaks out, if it be
not ſtopped in Time, into Botches of heroic
Rime ; for all Loverrs are poets for the Time

------------------------------------------------------------------------

being, and make their Ladies a Kind of mo-
ſaic Work of ſeveral coloured Stones joined
together by a ſtrong Fancy, but very ſtiff and
unnatural ; and though they ſteal Stars from
Heaven, as _Prometheus_ did Fire, to animate
them, all will not make them alive, nor
alives-liking.

A
BANKRUPT


I²S made by breaking, as a Bird is hatched
by breaking the Shell, for he gains more
by giving over his Trade, than ever he did by
dealing in it. He drives a Trade, as _Oliver_
_Cromwel_ did a Coach, till it broke in Pieces.
He is very tender and careful in preſerving
his Credit, and keeps it as methodically as a
Race-nag is dieted, that in the End he may
run away with it: for he observes a punctual
Curioſity in performing his Word, until he
has improved his Credit as far as it can go ;
and then he has catched the Fiſh, and throws
away the Net ; as a Butcher, when he has fed
his Beaſt as fat as it can grow, cuts the Throat

------------------------------------------------------------------------

of it. When he has brought his Deſign to
Perfection, and diſpoſed of all his Materials,
he lays his Train, like a Powder Traytor, and
gets out of the way, while he blows up all
thoſe that truſted him. After the Blow is
given there is no Manner of Intelligence to be
had of him for ſome Months, until the Rage
and Fury is ſomewhat digeſted, and all Hopes
vaniſhed of ever recovering any Thing of Body,
or Goods, for Revenge, or Reſtitution ; and
then Propoſitions of Treaty and Accommoda-
tion appear, like the Sign of the _Hand and Pen_
out of the Clouds, with Conditions more un-
reaſonable than Thieves are wont to demand
for Reſtitution of ſtolen Goods. He ſhoots
like a Fowler at a whole Flock of Geeſe at
once, and ſtalks with his Horſe to come as near
as poſſibly he can without being perceived by
any one, or giving the leaſt Suſpicion of his
Deſign, until it is too late to prevent it ; and
then he flies from them, as they ſhould have
done before from him. His Way is ſo com-
monly uſed in the City, that he robs in a Road,
like a Highwayman, and yet they will never
arrive at Wit enough to avoid it ; for it is done

------------------------------------------------------------------------

upon Surpriſe ; and as Thieves are commonly
better mounted than thoſe they rob, he very
eaſily makes his Eſcape, and flies beyond Per-
ſuit of Huon-cries, and there is no Poſſibility
of overtaking him.

A
RIBALD


I²S the Devil’s Hypocrite, the endeavours to
make himſelf appear worſe than he is. His
evil Words and bad Manners ſtrive which
ſhall moſt corrupt one another, and it is hard
to ſay which has the Advantage. He vents
his Lechery at the Mouth, as ſome Fiſhes are
ſaid to engender. He is an unclean Beaſt that
chews the Cud ; for after he has ſatisfied his
Lust, he brings it up again into his Mouth
to a ſecond Enjoyment, and plays an After-
game of Letchery with his Tongue much worſe
than that which the _Cunnilingi_ uſed among the
old _Romans._ He ſtrips Nature ſtark-naked, and
clothes her in the moſt fantaſtic and ridiculous
Faſhion a wild Imagination can invent. He
is worſe and more naſty than a Dog ; for
in his broad Deſcriptions of others obſcene
Actions he does but lick up the Vomit of ano-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ther Man’s Surfeits. He tells Tales out of a
vaulting School. A leud baudy Tale does
more Hurt, and gives a worſe Example than
the Thing of which it was told ; for the Act
extends but to a few, and if it be concealed
goes no further ; but the Report of it is un-
limited, and may be conveyed to all People,
and all Times to come. He expoſes that with
his Tongue, which Nature gave Women Mo-
deſty, and brute Beaſts Tails to cover. He
miſtakes Ribaldry for Wit, though nothing is
more unlike, and believes himſelf to be the
finer Man the filthier he talks ; as if he were
above Civility, as _Fanatics_ are above Ordinan-
ces, and held nothing more ſhameful than to be
aſhamed of any Thing. He talks nothing but
_Aretine_’s Pictures, as plain as the _Scotch_ Dia-
lect, which is eſteemed to be the moſt copious
and elegant of the Kind. He improves and
huſbands his Sins to the beſt Advantage,
and makes one Vice find Employment for
another ; for what he acts looſely in private,
he talks as looſely of in public, and finds as
much Pleaſure in the one as the other. He
endeavours to make himſelf Satisfaction for
the Pangs his Claps and Botches put him to with

------------------------------------------------------------------------

vapouring and bragging how he came by
them. He endeavours to purchaſe himſelf a
Reputation by pretending to that which the
beſt Men abominate, and the worſt value not,
like one that clips and waſhes falſe Coin, and
ventures his Neck for that which will yield
him nothing.
