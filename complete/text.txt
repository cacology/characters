PREFACE.


_T²HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit_
_much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt_
_Century, The two principal Authors in this Way_
_were Sir_ Thomas Overbury, _and Dr._ John
Earle _Tutor to Prince_ Charles _in_ 1643, _and after_
_the Reſtoration Dean of_ Weſtminſter, _and ſuc-_
_ceſſively Biſhop of_ Worceſter _and_ Saliſbury. _How_
_agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public_
_Taſte may be judged from Sir_ Thomas's _little Book_
_having fourteen Editions before_ 1632, _and the_
_Biſhop's ſix between_ 1628 _and_ 1633. _Whether_
Butler _has equalled or excelled them, and what_
_Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt_
_be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-_
_reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me_
_a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge. The Reader_
_will have an Opportunity of determining for him_
_ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame_
_Pictures._

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_As in ſuch a Variety of Characters there muſt_
_be ſome drawn from Originals in general the ſame,_
_and only differenced by particular Circumſtances,_
_the ſame Obſervations are ſometimes repeated._
_Whether the Author in this Caſe requires any Apo-_
_logy muſt be left to his Judges the Critics ; it is_
_enough for me that I can ſay I have done him_
_Justice in publiſhing them._

_As moſt of theſe Characters are dated when they_
_were compoſed, I can inform the curious, that they_
_were chiefly drawn up from_ 1667 _to_ 1669, _at_
_which time, as has been before obſerved,_ Butler
_reſided in_ Wales _under the Protection of Lord_
Carbery.

A
HUFFING COURTIER


I²s a Cypher, that has no Value himſelf, but
from the Place he ſtands in. All his Hap-
pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others
have of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-
retical and erroneous, though he ſuffer much
Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate, and
not to be convinced. He flutters up and down
like a Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is
pruning of his Peruque takes Occaſion to con-
template his Legs, and the Symmetry of his
Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the
Rooms, and ſerves for a walking Picture, a
moving Piece of Arras. His Buſineſs is only
to be ſeen, and he performs it with admirable
Industry, placing himself always in the beſt
Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-
tious whom he mixes withal. His Occupation
is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if they could but
walk themselves, they would ſave him the 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.
His Immunity from Varlets is his Freehold,
and he were a loſt Man without it. His
Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he
gives him, for ’tis ten to one he never pays for
them. He is very careful to diſcover the Lining
of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect any
Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the
Skin outwards. His Taylor is his Creator,
and makes him of nothing ; and though he
lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_
mitting Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells
in the Outſide of him, like that of a hollow
Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off him
he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of
himſelf is the wearing of his Cloaths, and,
like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is better than
his Body. His looking big is rather a Tumor,
than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt
ſo much Value, as other Men give him that
believe in him, but none of his own. He
makes him Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like
a Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get
through. He has juſt ſo much of Politics, as
Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have _Latin_. He is
as humble as a Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that
are below him ; and with a generous Scorn
deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither do him good,
nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do him
good, though he knows they never will ; and
deſpiſes thoſe, that would not hurt him, if
they could. The Court is his Church, and he
believes as that believes, and cries up and down
every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a
great Comfort to him to think, that ſome who
do not know him may perhaps take him for a
Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he looks
bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-
tance ; and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-
times know you, and ſometimes not. Nothing
but want of Money or Credit puts him in
mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts
Providence that ſomebody will truſt him ; and
in Expectation of that hopes for a better Life,
and that his Debts will never riſe up in Judg-
ment against him. To get in debt is to labour
in his Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his
Protection ; for what’s that worth to one that
owes Nothing ? His Employment being only to
wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his
Life and Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers
Books, that are his faithful Hiſtoriographers to

------------------------------------------------------------------------

their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes
ſo much Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;
and that no Man wears his Cloaths in Faſhion,
that pays for them, for noting is further from
the Mode. He believes that he that runs in
Debt is beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,
and only thoſe, that pay, are behind. His
Brains are turned giddy, like one that walks
on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon
it is ſo troubleſome to him to look downwards.
He is a Kind of Spectrum, and his Cloaths are
the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ; and
when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs
as buſily out of one Room into another, as a
great Practiſer does in _Weſtminſter_-Hall from
one Court to another. When he accoſts a
Lady he puts both Ends of his Microcoſm in
Motion, by making Legs at one End, and
combing his Peruque at the other. His Gar-
niture is the Sauce to his Cloaths, and he walks
in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in long
Graſs. Every Motion of him crys _Vanity of_
_Vanities, all is Vanity,_ quoth the Preacher. He
rides himself like a well-managed Horſe, reins
in his Neck, and walks _Terra Terra_. He
carries his elbows backward, as if he were

------------------------------------------------------------------------

pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit. His Legs are
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not
cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of
Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When he
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-
men do their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-
rows from Reflection. He is as tender of his
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as
loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery
is all his Happineſs ; and like _Atlas_ he carries
his Heaven on his Back. He is like the golden
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He
is a Monſter or an _Indian_ Creature, that is
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle

------------------------------------------------------------------------

in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-
dies to play upon, who when they have done
with him, let down his treble-String, till they
are in the Humour again. His Cook and Va-
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and
him ſo punctually together, that the one may
not be ready before the other. As Peacocks and
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,
yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to flutter
only. The Beggars call him _my Lord,_ and he
takes them at their Words, and pays them for
it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him
when you have him.

# AN
# ALDERMAN
[_two line initial_]HAS taken his Degree in Cheating, and
[_two line initial_] the higheſt of his Faculty ; or paid for
refuſing his _MANDAMUS_. He is a Peer of the
City, and a Member of their upper Houſe,
Who, as ſoon as he arrives at ſo many thouſand
Pounds, is bound by the Charter to ſerve the
Public with ſo much Underſtanding, what
ſhift ſoever he make to raiſe it, and wear a
Chain about his Neck like a Raindeer, or in
Default to commute, and make Satisfaction in
ready Money, the beſt Reaſon of the Place;
for which hi has the Name only, like a titular
Prince, and is an _Alderman extraordinary_. But
if his Wife can prevail with him to ſtand, he
becomes one of the City-ſupporters, and, like
the Unicorn in the King's Arms, wears a Chain
about his Neck very right-worſhipfully. He
wears Scarlet, as the Whore of _Babylon_ does,
not for her honeſty, but the Rank and Quality

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ſhe is of among the Wicked, When he ſits as a Judge in his Court he is
abſolute, and uſes arbitrary Power ; for he is not bound to un- derſtand
what he does, nor render an Account why he gives Judgment on one Side
rather than another ; but his Will is ſufficient to ſtand for his
Reaſon, to all Intents and Purpoſes. He does no public Buſineſs without
eating and drinking, and never meets about Matters of Im- portance, but
the Cramming his Inſide is the moſt weighty Part of the Work of the Day.
He diſpatches no public Affair until he has thoroughly dined upon it,
and is fully ſatisfied with Quince-Pye and Cuſtard : for Men are wiſer,
the _Italians_ ſay, after their Bellies are full, than when they are
faſting, and he is very cautious to omit no Occaſion of improving his
Parts that Way. He is ſo careful of the In- tereſt of his Belly, and
manages it ſo induſ- triouſly, that in a little Space it grows great and
takes Place of all the reſt of his Members, and becomes ſo powerful,
that they will never be in a Condition to rebel againſt it any more. He
is cloathed in Scarlet the Livery of his Sins, like the rich Glutton, to
put him in Mind of what Means he came to his Wealth and Pre- ferment by.
He makes a Trade of his Eat-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Sarah testing testing testing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ing, and, like a Cock, ſcrapes when he feeds; for the Public pays for
all and more, which he and his Brethren ſhare among themſelves ; for
they never make a dry Reckoning. When he comes to be Lord-Mayor he does
not keep a great Houſe, but a very great Houſe-warming for a whole Year
; for though he invites all the _Companies_ in the City he does not
treat them, but they club to entertain him, and pay the Reckoning
beforehand. His Fur-gown makes him look a great deal bigger than he is,
like the Feathers of an Owl, and when he pulls it off, he looks as if he
were fallen away, or like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.
