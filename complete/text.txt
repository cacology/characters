PREFACE.


_T²HE writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit_
_much in Faſhion in the Beginning of the laſt_
_Century, The two principal Authors in this Way_
_were Sir_ Thomas Overbury, _and Dr._ John
Earle _Tutor to Prince_ Charles _in_ 1643, _and after_
_the Reſtoration Dean of_ Weſtminſter, _and ſuc-_
_ceſſively Biſhop of_ Worceſter _and_ Saliſbury. _How_
_agreeable theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the public_
_Taſte may be judged from Sir_ Thomas's _little Book_
_having fourteen Editions before_ 1632, _and the_
_Biſhop's ſix between_ 1628 _and_ 1633. _Whether_
Butler _has equalled or excelled them, and what_
_Place he is to hold in this Claſs of Writers muſt_
_be left to the Deciſion of the Public, as the Inte-_
_reſt and Prejudice of a Publiſher may render me_
_a ſuſpected or an incompetent Judge. The Reader_
_will have an Opportunity of determining for him_
_ſelf, as they have all attempted to draw the ſame_
_Pictures._

------------------------------------------------------------------------

_As in ſuch a Variety of Characters there muſt_
_be ſome drawn from Originals in general the ſame,_
_and only differenced by particular Circumſtances,_
_the ſame Obſervations are ſometimes repeated._
_Whether the Author in this Caſe requires any Apo-_
_logy muſt be left to his Judges the Critics ; it is_
_enough for me that I can ſay I have done him_
_Justice in publiſhing them._

_As moſt of theſe Characters are dated when they_
_were compoſed, I can inform the curious, that they_
_were chiefly drawn up from_ 1667 _to_ 1669, _at_
_which time, as has been before obſerved,_ Butler
_reſided in_ Wales _under the Protection of Lord_
Carbery.

A
HUFFING COURTIER


I²s a Cypher, that has no Value himſelf, but
from the Place he ſtands in. All his Hap-
pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others
have of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-
retical and erroneous, though he ſuffer much
Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate, and
not to be convinced. He flutters up and down
like a Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is
pruning of his Peruque takes Occaſion to con-
template his Legs, and the Symmetry of his
Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the
Rooms, and ſerves for a walking Picture, a
moving Piece of Arras. His Buſineſs is only
to be ſeen, and he performs it with admirable
Industry, placing himself always in the beſt
Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-
tious whom he mixes withal. His Occupation
is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if they could but
walk themselves, they would ſave him the 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.
His Immunity from Varlets is his Freehold,
and he were a loſt Man without it. His
Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he
gives him, for ’tis ten to one he never pays for
them. He is very careful to diſcover the Lining
of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect any
Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the
Skin outwards. His Taylor is his Creator,
and makes him of nothing ; and though he
lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_
mitting Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells
in the Outſide of him, like that of a hollow
Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off him
he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of
himſelf is the wearing of his Cloaths, and,
like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is better than
his Body. His looking big is rather a Tumor,
than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt
ſo much Value, as other Men give him that
believe in him, but none of his own. He
makes him Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like
a Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get
through. He has juſt ſo much of Politics, as
Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have _Latin_. He is
as humble as a Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that
are below him ; and with a generous Scorn
deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither do him good,
nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do him
good, though he knows they never will ; and
deſpiſes thoſe, that would not hurt him, if
they could. The Court is his Church, and he
believes as that believes, and cries up and down
every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a
great Comfort to him to think, that ſome who
do not know him may perhaps take him for a
Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he looks
bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-
tance ; and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-
times know you, and ſometimes not. Nothing
but want of Money or Credit puts him in
mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts
Providence that ſomebody will truſt him ; and
in Expectation of that hopes for a better Life,
and that his Debts will never riſe up in Judg-
ment against him. To get in debt is to labour
in his Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his
Protection ; for what’s that worth to one that
owes Nothing ? His Employment being only to
wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his
Life and Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers
Books, that are his faithful Hiſtoriographers to

------------------------------------------------------------------------

their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes
ſo much Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;
and that no Man wears his Cloaths in Faſhion,
that pays for them, for noting is further from
the Mode. He believes that he that runs in
Debt is beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,
and only thoſe, that pay, are behind. His
Brains are turned giddy, like one that walks
on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon
it is ſo troubleſome to him to look downwards.
He is a Kind of Spectrum, and his Cloaths are
the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ; and
when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs
as buſily out of one Room into another, as a
great Practiſer does in _Weſtminſter_-Hall from
one Court to another. When he accoſts a
Lady he puts both Ends of his Microcoſm in
Motion, by making Legs at one End, and
combing his Peruque at the other. His Gar-
niture is the Sauce to his Cloaths, and he walks
in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in long
Graſs. Every Motion of him crys _Vanity of_
_Vanities, all is Vanity,_ quoth the Preacher. He
rides himself like a well-managed Horſe, reins
in his Neck, and walks _Terra Terra_. He
carries his elbows backward, as if he were

------------------------------------------------------------------------

pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as
ſtiff as if he was upon the Spit. His Legs are
ſtuck in his great voluminous Britches, like
the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe abundant
Britches, in which his nether Parts are not
cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long
in a Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now
almoſt worn to Nothing ; if it do not recover
quickly it will grown too little for a Head of
Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of
his Shoes to juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,
or ſuch other Malady, that for the Time being
is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When he
ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-
men do their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons
are of the true Complexion of his Mind, a
Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,
that has no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-
rows from Reflection. He is as tender of his
Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and as
loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery
is all his Happineſs ; and like _Atlas_ he carries
his Heaven on his Back. He is like the golden
Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He
is a Monſter or an _Indian_ Creature, that is
good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.
He puts himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle

------------------------------------------------------------------------

in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-
dies to play upon, who when they have done
with him, let down his treble-String, till they
are in the Humour again. His Cook and Va-
let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and
him ſo punctually together, that the one may
not be ready before the other. As Peacocks and
Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt Feathers,
yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to flutter
only. The Beggars call him _my Lord,_ and he
takes them at their Words, and pays them for
it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo true and faith-
ful to the Mode, that he never fails to make
you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-
fuſed, tho’ you know not what to do with him
when you have him.

AN
ANTIQUARY


I²s one that has his Being in this Age, but
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of
old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like
the Madman, that fell in Love with _Cleopatra_.
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm
in his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts. He
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into
the World. He ſpends the one half of his
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes
ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does
it, the further they are from being new to him.
All his Curiouſities take place of one another
according to their Seniority, and he values
them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.
He has a great Veneration for Words that are
ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that
they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe
he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-
tiquity, and the good Services they have done.
He throws away his Time in enquiring after
that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,
like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find
out another that was loſt before. He fetches
things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable
of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own
Aſhes. He values one old Invention, that is
loſt and never to be recovered, before all the
new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.
The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with
his, that ſhows the Tombs at _Westminster_, only
the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other
for Money. As every Man has but one Fa-
ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World
of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value

------------------------------------------------------------------------

for Things that are antient, and the further off
the greater.

He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,
but is wholly retied from the preſent. His
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of
them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to
any Thing that is old, that he may truly _ſay to_
_Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-_
_tenneſs thou are my Mother_. He has no Provi-
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-
tions look backward upon the Days of old,
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he
walked backwards. He had rather interpret
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious
new one ; and with _Scaliger_ would ſell the
Empire of _Germany_[1] (if it were in his Power)
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values

------------------------------------------------------------------------

it above any Thing printed, which he accounts
but a Novelty. When he happens to cure a
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they
are made up. He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince
out of Uſe ; as the _Catholics_ allow of no Saints,
but ſuch as are dead, and the _Fanatics_, Op-
poſition, of none but the Living.

that coſt Necks are too chargea-/ ble) to try it in little, and have
depoſed King/ _Oberon,_ to erect their Monarchy in _Fairy-Land,_/ as
being the moſt proper and natural Region in/ the whole World for their

vil's_ Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,/ and the Glory of

the Kingdom of Dark-/ neſs as the _fifth-Monarchy,_ that is no where/ to

Lineaments in them all. The poor/ Wicked are like to have a very ill

according to their ancient and fun-/ damental Revelations, and to have
no Subjects/ but Slaves, who between them and the _Devil_/ are like to
ſuffer Perſecution enough to make/ them as able Saints, as their Lords
and Maſ-/ ters. He gather Churches on the Sunday, as/ the _Jew_ did
Sitkcs on their Sabbath, to ſet the/ State on Fire. He humms and hahs
high Trea-/ ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the/ Caſt they
would throw. He groans Sedition,/ and, like the _Phariſee,_ rails, when

ssmall Stock, and no Credit. He believes it is Inventions enough to find
out other Men's Wit; and whatssoever he lights upon either in Books, or
Company, he makes bold with as his own. This he puts together sso un-
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit has the Rickets, by the
Sswelling Dissproportion of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of
him; him; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that he has catched of
others; and his Flame like that of Charcoals that were burnt before :

troublesome in him: For as thosse, that have Money but sseldom, are
always sshak- ing their Pockets, when they have it; sso does he, when he
thinks he has got ssomething, that will make him appear. He is a
perpetual Tal- ker; and you may know by the Freedom of his Disscoursse,
that he came light by it, as Thieves sspend fiercely what they get. He
meassures other Men's Wits by {i}their{i} Modessty, and his own by
{i}his{i} Confidence. He makes nothing of writing Plays, becausse he has
not Wit enough to un- derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-ture
to talk and sscribble, as Chowsses do to play with cunning Gamessters,
until they are cheated and laughed at. He is always talking of Wit, as
thosse, that have bad Voices, are always ssing- ing out of Tune; and
thosse, that cannot play, delight to fumble on Insstruments. He grows
the unwisser by other Men's Harms; for the worsse others write, he finds
the more Encou- ragement to do sso too. His Greedinesss of Praisse is
sso eager, that he sswallows any Thing, that comes in the Likenesss of
it, how notorious and palpable ssoever, and is as Shot-free againsst any
Thing, that may lessssen his good Opinion

inssensible.

If you disslike him it is at your own Peril; he is ssure to put in a
Caveat beforehand againsst your Understanding; and, like a Malefac-tor
in Wit, is always fursinssed with Exceptions against his Judges. This
puts him upon perpe- tual Apologies, Excusses, and Defences, but sstil
by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif- fling Strain, without Regard of
any Man, that sstands in the Way of his Pageant. Where he thinks he may
do it ssafely, he will confidently own other Men's Writings; and where
he fears the Truth may be disscovered, he will by feeble Denials and
feigned Inssinua- tions give Men Occassion to ssupposse sso.

If he undersstands [i] Latin [i] or [i] Greek [i] he ranks himsself
among the Learned, desspisses the Igno- rant, talks Criticissms out of
[i] Scaliger[i], and re- peats [i] Martial's [i] baudy Epigrams, and
ssets up his Resst wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be not sso well

professsses to write with as great Facility, as if his Musse was

well ssaid he sseizes upon by poetical Licence; and one Way makes it his
own, that is by ill repeating of it--This he believes to be no more
Theft, than it is to take that, which others throw away. By this means
his Writings are, like a Taylor's Cusshion, of mossaic Work, made up of
sseveral Scraps ssewed together, He calls a sslovenly nassty
Desscription [i] great Na- ture,[i] and dull Flatnesss [i] strange
Eassiness.[i] He writes down all that comes in his Head, and makes no
Choice, becausse he has nothing to do it with, that is Judgment. He is
always repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like the [i] long
Parliament [i] making [i] Ordinances [i] in their Stead; although they
are perpetually [i] thrown out [i] of Coffee-Housses, and come to
Nothing. He is like an [i]Italian [i] Thief, that never robs, but he
murthers, to prevent Disscovery; sso ssure is he to cry down the Man
from whom he pur- loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may passs
unssusspec-ted. He is byt a Copier at besst, and will never arrive to
prac-tice by the Life: For bar him the Imitation of ssomething he has

Obs_ervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form of jus_t Wit, are above his
Philos_ophy. He appears s_o over concerned in all Men's Wits, as if they
were but Dis_paragements of his own; and crys down all they do, as if
they were Encroachments upon him. He takes Jes_ts fromt he Owners and
breaks them, as [i] Justices[i] do fals_e Weights, and Pots that want
Meas_ure. When he meets with any Thing, that is very good, he change it
into s_mall Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to s_erve s_everal
Occas_ions. He dis_claims Study, pretends to take Things in Motion, and
to s_hoot flying, which appears to be very true by his often mis_s_ing
of his Mark. His Wit is much troubled with Obs_truc_tions; and he has
Fits as painful as thos_e of the Spleen. He fancies him- s_elf a dainty
s_pruce Shepherd, with a Flock and a fine s_ilken Shepherds_s, that
follows his Pipe, as Rats did the Conjurers in [i] Germany.[i]

As for [i] Epithets, [i] he always avoids those, that are near akin to
the Sens_se. Such matches are unlawful, and not fit to be made by a [i]

titude of s_mall Poets in cons_tant Employment. He has found out a new
Sort of poetical [i]Geor- gics, [i] a Trick of s_owing Wit like
clover-gras_s on barren Subjec_ts, which would yield nothing before.
This is very us_eful for the Times, wherein, s_ome men s_ay, there is no
Room left for new Invention. He will take three Grains of Wit like the
Elixir, and projec_ting it upon the [i] Iron-Age [i] turns it
immediately into [i] Gold--[i] All the Bus_iness of Mankind has
pres_ently vanis_hed, the whole World has kept Holiday; there has been
no Men but Heroes and Poets, no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdes_s_es;
Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed Plum-Porrige.

    We read that [i] Virgil [i] us*ed to make fifty or
    s*ixty Vers*es in a Morning, and afterwards re-
    duce them to ten. This was an unthrifty
    Vanity, and argues him as well ignorant in the

it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine- pence. And as s_uch
Cours_es brough the [i] prodigal Son [i] to eat with Hogs: So they did
him to feed with Hors_es, which were not much better Company, and may
teach us to avoid doing the like. For certainly it is more noble to take
four or five Grains of Sens_e, and, like a Gold-Beater, hammer them into
s*o many Leaves as will fill a whole Book; than to write nothing but
Epitomes, which many wife Men believe will be the Bane and Calamity of
Learning.

When he writes, he commonly s_teers the Sens_e of his Lines by the Rhime
that is at the End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the Tail. For when
he has made one Line, which is eas_y enough; and has found out s_ome
s_turdy hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham- mer the Sens_e upon
it, like a Piece of hot Iron upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleas*es.

There is no Art in the World s_o rich in Terms as Poetry; a whole
Dic_tionary is s_carce

[i] So they did him to feed with Hors_es] This mus_t be explained by the
s_ame Writer of [i] Virgil's[i] Life, who informs us that [Virgil] in
his Youth s_tudied Phys_ic, in which having made great Proficiency, he
repaired to [i] Rome, [i] and applying hims_elf to that Branch of it

able to contain them: For there is hardly a Pond, a Sheep-walk, or a
Gravel-pit in all [i] Greece, [i] but the antient Name of it is become a
Term of Art in Poetry. By this means s_mall Poets have s_uch a Stock of
able hard Words lying by them, as [i] Dryades, Hamadryades, Aonides,
Fauni, Nymphae, Sylvani, &c.[i] that s_ignify nothing at all; and s_uch
a World of pedantic Terms of the s_ame Kind, as may s_erve to furnis*h
all the new Inventions and [i] thorough-Reformations, [i] that can
happen between this and [i] Plato's[i] great Year.

When he writes he never proposes any Scope or Purpos_e to hims_elf, but
gives h Genius all Freedom: For as he, that rides abroad for his
Pleas_ure, can hardly be out of his Way; s_o he that writes for his
Pleas_ure, can s_eldom be be- s_ide his Subjec_t. It is an ungrateful
Thing to a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing--- To what Purpos_e did
the Antients feign [i] Pegas_us to have Wings, if he mus_t be confined
to the Road and Stages like a Pack-Hors*e, or be forced to be obedient
to Hedges and Ditches? There-

He'll take s_cant Piece of coars_e Sens_e, and s_tretch it on the
Tenterhooks of half a s_core Rhimes, utnil it crack that you may s_ee
through it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head. When you s_ee his Vers_es

Abs_urdity, when laying the Scene of his fourth Satyr in [i] Greece [i],

call the [i] Gre- cians [i] Quirites.

AN
ALDERMAN


H²AS taken his Degree in Cheating, and
the higheſt of his Faculty ; or paid for
refuſing his _MANDAMUS_. He is a Peer of the
City, and a Member of their upper Houſe,
Who, as ſoon as he arrives at ſo many thouſand
Pounds, is bound by the Charter to ſerve the
Public with ſo much Underſtanding, what
ſhift ſoever he make to raiſe it, and wear a
Chain about his Neck like a Raindeer, or in
Default to commute, and make Satisfaction in
ready Money, the beſt Reaſon of the Place;
for which hi has the Name only, like a titular
Prince, and is an _Alderman extraordinary_. But
if his Wife can prevail with him to ſtand, he
becomes one of the City-ſupporters, and, like
the Unicorn in the King's Arms, wears a Chain
about his Neck very right-worſhipfully. He
wears Scarlet, as the Whore of _Babylon_ does,
not for her honeſty, but the Rank and Quality

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ſhe is of among the Wicked, When he ſits
as a Judge in his Court he is abſolute, and uſes
arbitrary Power ; for he is not bound to un-
derſtand what he does, nor render an Account
why he gives Judgment on one Side rather
than another ; but his Will is ſufficient to ſtand
for his Reaſon, to all Intents and Purpoſes.
He does no public Buſineſs without eating and
drinking, and never meets about Matters of Im-
portance, but the Cramming his Inſide is the
moſt weighty Part of the Work of the Day.
He diſpatches no public Affair until he has
thoroughly dined upon it, and is fully ſatisfied
with Quince-Pye and Cuſtard : for Men are
wiſer, the _Italians_ ſay, after their Bellies are
full, than when they are faſting, and he is very
cautious to omit no Occaſion of improving his
Parts that Way. He is ſo careful of the In-
tereſt of his Belly, and manages it ſo induſ-
triouſly, that in a little Space it grows great
and takes Place of all the reſt of his Members,
and becomes ſo powerful, that they will never
be in a Condition to rebel againſt it any more.
He is cloathed in Scarlet the Livery of his Sins,
like the rich Glutton, to put him in Mind of
what Means he came to his Wealth and Pre-
ferment by. He makes a Trade of his Eat-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ing, and, like a Cock, ſcrapes when he feeds ;
for the Public pays for all and more, which he
and his Brethren ſhare among themſelves ; for
they never make a dry Reckoning. When he
comes to be Lord-Mayor he does not keep a
great Houſe, but a very great Houſe-warming
for a whole Year ; for though he invites all the
_Companies_ in the City he does not treat them,
but they club to entertain him, and pay the
Reckoning beforehand. His Fur-gown makes
him look a great deal bigger than he is, like
the Feathers of an Owl, and when he pulls
it off, he looks as if he were fallen away, or
like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.

A
RIBALD


I²S the Devil’s Hypocrite, the endeavours to
make himſelf appear worſe than he is. His
evil Words and bad Manners ſtrive which
ſhall moſt corrupt one another, and it is hard
to ſay which has the Advantage. He vents
his Lechery at the Mouth, as ſome Fiſhes are
ſaid to engender. He is an unclean Beaſt that
chews the Cud ; for after he has ſatisfied his
Lust, he brings it up again into his Mouth
to a ſecond Enjoyment, and plays an After-
game of Letchery with his Tongue much worſe
than that which the _Cunnilingi_ uſed among the
old _Romans._ He ſtrips Nature ſtark-naked, and
clothes her in the moſt fantaſtic and ridiculous
Faſhion a wild Imagination can invent. He
is worſe and more naſty than a Dog ; for
in his broad Deſcriptions of others obſcene
Actions he does but lick up the Vomit of ano-

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ther Man’s Surfeits. He tells Tales out of a
vaulting School. A leud baudy Tale does
more Hurt, and gives a worſe Example than
the Thing of which it was told ; for the Act
extends but to a few, and if it be concealed
goes no further ; but the Report of it is un-
limited, and may be conveyed to all People,
and all Times to come. He expoſes that with
his Tongue, which Nature gave Women Mo-
deſty, and brute Beaſts Tails to cover. He
miſtakes Ribaldry for Wit, though nothing is
more unlike, and believes himſelf to be the
finer Man the filthier he talks ; as if he were
above Civility, as _Fanatics_ are above Ordinan-
ces, and held nothing more ſhameful than to be
aſhamed of any Thing. He talks nothing but
_Aretine_’s Pictures, as plain as the _Scotch_ Dia-
lect, which is eſteemed to be the moſt copious
and elegant of the Kind. He improves and
huſbands his Sins to the beſt Advantage,
and makes one Vice find Employment for
another ; for what he acts looſely in private,
he talks as looſely of in public, and finds as
much Pleaſure in the one as the other. He
endeavours to make himſelf Satisfaction for
the Pangs his Claps and Botches put him to with

------------------------------------------------------------------------

vapouring and bragging how he came by
them. He endeavours to purchaſe himſelf a
Reputation by pretending to that which the
beſt Men abominate, and the worſt value not,
like one that clips and waſhes falſe Coin, and
ventures his Neck for that which will yield
him nothing.

which he was particularly pleased with.
