  writing of Characters was a Kind of
  Wit</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">much in Faſhion in the

  The two principal Authors in this

  Overbury, <hi rendition="simple:italic">and Dr.</hi> John<lb />Earle
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Tutor to Prince</hi> Charles

  ſuc-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">ceſſively Biſhop of</hi>
  Worceſter <hi rendition="simple:italic">and</hi> Saliſbury.
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">How</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">agreeable
  theſe Sorts of Eſſays were to the
  public</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Taſte may be judged
  from Sir</hi> Thomas’s <hi rendition="simple:italic">little

  before</hi> 1632, <hi rendition="simple:italic">and
  the</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Biſhop’s ſix between</hi>
  1628 <hi rendition="simple:italic">and</hi> 1633.
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Whether</hi><lb />Butler
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">has equalled or excelled them, and
  what</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Place he is to hold in
  this Claſs of Writers muſt</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">be

  <head>A<lb />HUFFING COURTIER</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>s a Cypher, that has no
  Value himſelf, but<lb />from the Place he ſtands in. All his
  Hap-<lb />pineſs conſiſts in the Opinion he believes others<lb />have
  of it. This is his Faith, but as it is he-<lb />retical and erroneous,
  though he ſuffer much<lb />Tribulation for it, he continues obſtinate,
  and<lb />not to be convinced. He flutters up and down<lb />like a
  Butterfly in a Garden ; and while he is<lb />pruning of his Peruque
  takes Occaſion to con-<lb />template his Legs, and the Symmetry of
  his<lb />Britches. He is part of the Furniture of the<lb />Rooms, and
  ſerves for a walking Picture, a<lb />moving Piece of Arras. His
  Buſineſs is only<lb />to be ſeen, and he performs it with
  admirable<lb />Industry, placing himself always in the
  beſt<lb />Light, looking wonderfully Politic, and cau-<lb />tious whom
  he mixes withal. His Occupation<lb />is to ſhow his Cloaths, and if
  they could but<lb />walk themselves, they would ſave him the </p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>Labour, and do his Work as well as himſelf.<lb />His Immunity from
  Varlets is his Freehold,<lb />and he were a loſt Man without it.
  His<lb />Cloaths are but his Taylor's Livery, which he<lb />gives him,
  for ’tis ten to one he never pays for<lb />them. He is very careful to
  diſcover the Lining<lb />of his Coat, that you may not ſuſpect
  any<lb />Want of Integrity of Flaw in him from the<lb />Skin outwards.
  His Taylor is his Creator,<lb />and makes him of nothing ; and though
  he<lb />lives by Faith in him, he is perpetually com_<lb />mitting
  Iniquities againſt him. His Soul dwells<lb />in the Outſide of him,
  like that of a hollow<lb />Tree ; and if you do but pill the Bark off
  him<lb />he deceaſes immediately. His Carriage of<lb />himſelf is the
  wearing of his Cloaths, and,<lb />like the Cinamon Tree, his Bark is
  better than<lb />his Body. His looking big is rather a
  Tumor,<lb />than Greatneſs. He is an Idol, that has juſt<lb />ſo much
  Value, as other Men give him that<lb />believe in him, but none of his
  own. He<lb />makes him Ignorance paſs for Reſerve, and, like<lb />a
  Hunting-nag, leaps over what he cannot get<lb />through. He has juſt
  ſo much of Politics, as<lb />Hoſtlers in the Univerſity have
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Latin</hi>. He is<lb />as humble as a
  Jeſuit to his Superior ; but re-<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>pays himſelf again in Inſolence over thoſe, that<lb />are below
  him ; and with a generous Scorn<lb />deſpiſes thoſe, that can neither
  do him good,<lb />nor hurt. He adores thoſe, that may do
  him<lb />good, though he knows they never will ; and<lb />deſpiſes
  thoſe, that would not hurt him, if<lb />they could. The Court is his
  Church, and he<lb />believes as that believes, and cries up and
  down<lb />every Thing, as he finds it paſs there. It is a<lb />great
  Comfort to him to think, that ſome who<lb />do not know him may
  perhaps take him for a<lb />Lord ; and while that Thought laſts he
  looks<lb />bigger than uſual, and forgets his Acquain-<lb />tance ;
  and that's the Reaſon why he will ſome-<lb />times know you, and
  ſometimes not. Nothing<lb />but want of Money or Credit puts him
  in<lb />mind that he is mortal ; but then he truſts<lb />Providence
  that ſomebody will truſt him ; and<lb />in Expectation of that hopes
  for a better Life,<lb />and that his Debts will never riſe up in
  Judg-<lb />ment against him. To get in debt is to labour<lb />in his
  Vocation ; but to pay is to forfeit his<lb />Protection ; for what’s
  that worth to one that<lb />owes Nothing ? His Employment being only
  to<lb />wear his Cloaths, the whole Account of his<lb />Life and
  Actions is recorded in Shopkeepers<lb />Books, that are his faithful
  Hiſtoriographers to<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>their own Poſterity ; and he believes he loſes<lb />ſo much
  Reputation, as he pays off his Debts ;<lb />and that no Man wears his
  Cloaths in Faſhion,<lb />that pays for them, for noting is further
  from<lb />the Mode. He believes that he that runs in<lb />Debt is
  beforehand with thoſe that truſt him,<lb />and only thoſe, that pay,
  are behind. His<lb />Brains are turned giddy, like one that
  walks<lb />on the Top of a Houſe ; and that’s the Reaſon<lb />it is ſo
  troubleſome to him to look downwards.<lb />He is a Kind of Spectrum,
  and his Cloaths are<lb />the Shape he takes to appear and walk in ;
  and<lb />when he puts them off he vaniſhes. He runs<lb />as buſily out
  of one Room into another, as a<lb />great Practiſer does in
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall from<lb />one
  Court to another. When he accoſts a<lb />Lady he puts both Ends of his
  Microcoſm in<lb />Motion, by making Legs at one End, and<lb />combing
  his Peruque at the other. His Gar-<lb />niture is the Sauce to his
  Cloaths, and he walks<lb />in his Portcannons like one, that ſtalks in
  long<lb />Graſs. Every Motion of him crys
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Vanity
  of</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Vanities, all is
  Vanity,</hi> quoth the Preacher. He<lb />rides himself like a
  well-managed Horſe, reins<lb />in his Neck, and walks
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Terra Terra</hi>. He<lb />carries his
  elbows backward, as if he were<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>pinioned like a truſt-up Fowl, and moves as<lb />ſtiff as if he was
  upon the Spit. His Legs are<lb />ſtuck in his great voluminous
  Britches, like<lb />the Whiſtles in a Bagpipe, thoſe
  abundant<lb />Britches, in which his nether Parts are
  not<lb />cloathed, but packt up. His Hat has been long<lb />in a
  Conſumption of the Faſhion, and is now<lb />almoſt worn to Nothing ;
  if it do not recover<lb />quickly it will grown too little for a Head
  of<lb />Garlick. He wears Garniture on the Toes of<lb />his Shoes to
  juſtify his Prentenſions to the Gout,<lb />or ſuch other Malady, that
  for the Time being<lb />is moſt in Fashion or Requeſt. When
  he<lb />ſalutes a Friend he pulls off his Hat, as Wo-<lb />men do
  their Vizard-Maſques. His Ribbons<lb />are of the true Complexion of
  his Mind, a<lb />Kind of painted Cloud or gawdy Rainbow,<lb />that has
  no Colour of it ſelf, but what is bor-<lb />rows from Reflection. He
  is as tender of his<lb />Cloaths, as a Coward is of his Fleſh, and
  as<lb />loth to have them diſordered. His Bravery<lb />is all his
  Happineſs ; and like <hi rendition="simple:italic">Atlas</hi> he
  carries<lb />his Heaven on his Back. He is like the
  golden<lb />Fleece, a fine Outſide on a Sheep’s Back. He<lb />is a
  Monſter or an <hi rendition="simple:italic">Indian</hi> Creature, that
  is<lb />good for nothing in the World but to be ſeen.<lb />He puts
  himſelf up into a Sedan, like a Fiddle<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>in a Caſe, and is taken out again for the La-<lb />dies to play
  upon, who when they have done<lb />with him, let down his
  treble-String, till they<lb />are in the Humour again. His Cook and
  Va-<lb />let de Chambre conſpire to dreſs Dinner and<lb />him ſo
  punctually together, that the one may<lb />not be ready before the
  other. As Peacocks and<lb />Oſtridges have the gaudieſt and fineſt
  Feathers,<lb />yet cannot fly ; ſo all his Bravery is to
  flutter<lb />only. The Beggars call him
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">my Lord,</hi> and he<lb />takes them at
  their Words, and pays them for<lb />it. If you praiſe him, he is ſo
  true and faith-<lb />ful to the Mode, that he never fails to
  make<lb />you a Preſent of himſelf, and will not be re-<lb />fuſed,
  tho’ you know not what to do with him<lb />when you have
  him.<lb /></p>

  <head>AN<lb />ANTIQUARY</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>s one that has his Being
  in this Age, but<lb />his Life and Converſation is in the Days
  of<lb />old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-<lb />vation, and
  ſlights the future ; but has a great<lb />Value for that, which is
  paſt and gone, like<lb />the Madman, that fell in Love with
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Cleopatra</hi>.<lb />He is an old
  frippery-Philoſopher, that has<lb />ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to
  worm-eaten<lb />Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm<lb />in
  his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and<lb />Fore-mothers, but
  condemns his Parents as<lb />too modern, and no better than Upſtarts.
  He<lb />neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his<lb />own Time,
  and ſo far off Antiquity, which<lb />he ſo much admires ; and repines,
  like a<lb />younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into<lb />the
  World. He ſpends the one half of his<lb />Time in collecting old
  inſignificant Trifles,<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes<lb />ſingular Delight
  in ; becauſe the oftener he does<lb />it, the further they are from
  being new to him.<lb />All his Curiouſities take place of one
  another<lb />according to their Seniority, and he values<lb />them not
  by their Abilities, but their Standing.<lb />He has a great Veneration
  for Words that are<lb />ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged,
  that<lb />they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe<lb />he uſes
  with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-<lb />tiquity, and the good
  Services they have done.<lb />He throws away his Time in enquiring
  after<lb />that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,<lb />like
  one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find<lb />out another that was loſt
  before. He fetches<lb />things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the
  Fable<lb />of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own<lb />Aſhes. He
  values one old Invention, that is<lb />loſt and never to be recovered,
  before all the<lb />new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo
  uſeful.<lb />The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with<lb />his,
  that ſhows the Tombs at
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Westminster</hi>, only<lb />the one does
  it for his Pleaſure, and the other<lb />for Money. As every Man has
  but one Fa-<lb />ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World<lb />of
  Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>for Things that are antient, and the further off<lb />the
  greater.</p>
  <p>He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time<lb />out of Mind, to
  which he conforms exactly,<lb />but is wholly retied from the preſent.
  His<lb />Days were ſpent and gone long before he came<lb />into the
  World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is<lb />to collect what he can out
  of the Ruins of<lb />them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection
  to<lb />any Thing that is old, that he may truly
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">ſay
  to</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Duſt and Worms you are my
  Father, and to Rot-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">tenneſs
  thou are my Mother</hi>. He has no Provi-<lb />dence nor Fore-ſight ;
  for all his Contempla-<lb />tions look backward upon the Days of
  old,<lb />and his Brains are turned with them, as if he<lb />walked
  backwards. He had rather interpret<lb />one obſcure Word in any old
  ſenſeleſs Diſ-<lb />courſe, than be the Author of the moſt
  ingenious<lb />new one ; and with
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Scaliger</hi> would ſell the<lb />Empire
  of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Germany</hi><note>
    <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">And with</hi> Scaliger
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">would ſell the Empire of Germany</hi>]
    This al-<lb />ludes to a ranting Exclamation of
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Scaliger</hi>’s upon an Ode in
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Horace</hi>,<lb />which he was
    particularly pleased with.</p>
  </note> (if it were in his Power)<lb />for an old Song. He devours an
  old Manuſ-<lb />cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and
  Moths<lb />do, and, though there be nothing in it, values<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>it above any Thing printed, which he accounts<lb />but a Novelty.
  When he happens to cure a<lb />ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as
  proud<lb />of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,<lb />and
  could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.<lb />He values things
  wrongfully upon their Anti-<lb />quity, forgetting that the moſt
  modern are<lb />really the moſt ancient of all Things in
  the<lb />World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds<lb />before their
  Shillings and Pence, of which they<lb />are made up. He eſteems no
  Cuſtoms but ſuch<lb />as have outlived themſelves, and are long
  ſince<lb />out of Uſe ; as the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Catholics</hi> allow of no
  Saints,<lb />but ſuch as are dead, and the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fanatics</hi>, Op-<lb />poſition, of
  none but the Living.<lb /></p>

  <head>A<lb />PROUD MAN</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>S a Fool in Fermentation,
  that ſwells and<lb />boils over like a Porridge-Pot. He ſets
  out<lb />his Feathers like an Owl, to ſwell and ſeem<lb />bigger than
  he is. He is troubled with a Tu-<lb />mour and Inflammation of
  Self-Conceit, that<lb />renders every Part of him ſtiff and
  uneaſy.<lb />He has given himſelf Sympathetic Love-Pow-<lb />der, that
  works upon him to Dotage, and has<lb />transformed him into his own
  Miſtreſs. He<lb />is his own Gallant, and makes moſt
  paſſionate<lb />Addreſſes to his own dear Perfections. He<lb />commits
  Idolatry to himſelf, and worſhips<lb />his own Image ; though there is
  no Soul living<lb />of his Church but himſelf, yet he believes
  as<lb />the Church believes, and maintains his Faith<lb />with the
  Obſtinacy of a <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fanatic.</hi> He is his
  own<lb />Favourite, and advance himſelf not only above<lb />his Merit,
  but all Mankind ; is both
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Damon</hi><lb />and
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pythias</hi> to his own dear ſelf, and
  values his<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>Crony above his Soul. He gives Place to no<lb />Man but himſelf,
  and that with very great<lb />Diſtance to all others, whom he eſteems
  not<lb />worthy to approach him. He believes what-<lb />ſoever he has
  receives a Value in being his ;<lb />as a Horſe in a Nobleman’s Stable
  will bear a<lb />greater Price than in a common Market. He<lb />is ſo
  proud, that he is as hard to be acquainted<lb />with himſelf as with
  others ; for he is very<lb />apt to forget who he is, and knows
  himſelf<lb />only ſuperficially ; therefore he treats
  himſelf<lb />civilly as a ſtranger with Ceremony and
  Com-<lb />pliment, but admits of no Privacy. He ſtrives<lb />to look
  bigger than himſelf, as well as others,<lb />and is no better than his
  own Paraſite and<lb />Flatterer. A little Flood will make a
  ſhallow<lb />Torrent ſwell above its Banks, and rage, and<lb />foam,
  and yield a roaring Noiſe, while a deep<lb />ſilent Stream glides
  quietly on. So a vain-<lb />glorious inſolent proud Man ſwells with a
  little<lb />frail Proſperity, grows big and loud, and over-<lb />flows
  his Bounds, and when he ſinks, leaves<lb />Mud and Dirt behind him.
  His Carriage is<lb />as glorious and haughty, as if he were
  advan-<lb />ced upon Men’s Shoulders, or tumbled over<lb />their Heads
  like Knipperdolling. He fancies/</p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>himſelf a Coloſſe, and ſo he is, for his Head<lb />holds no
  Proportion to his Body, and his foun-<lb />dation is leſſer than his
  upper Stories. We<lb />can naturally take no view of our ſelves,
  un-<lb />leſs we look downwards, to teach us how<lb />humble Admirers
  we ought to be of our own<lb />Values. The ſlighter and leſs ſolid his
  Mate-<lb />rials are, the more Room they take up, and<lb />make him
  ſwell the bigger ; as Feathers and<lb />Cotton will ſtuff Cuſhions
  better than Things<lb />of more cloſe and ſolid Parts.<lb /></p>

  to find out other Men's Wit; and whatssoever he lights upon either in
  Books, or Company, he makes bold with as his own. This he puts

  does he, when he thinks he has got ssomething, that will make him
  appear. He is a perpetual Tal- ker; and you may know by the Freedom of
  his Disscoursse, that he came light by it, as Thieves sspend fiercely
  what they get. He meassures other Men's Wits by {i}their{i} Modessty,
  and his own by {i}his{i} Confidence. He makes nothing of writing
  Plays, becausse he has not Wit enough to un- derstand the Difficulty.
  This makes him ven-ture to talk and sscribble, as Chowsses do to play
  with cunning Gamessters, until they are cheated and laughed at. He is
  always talking of Wit, as thosse, that have bad Voices, are always
  ssing- ing out of Tune; and thosse, that cannot play, delight to
  fumble on Insstruments. He grows the unwisser by other Men's Harms;
  for the worsse others write, he finds the more Encou- ragement to do
  sso too. His Greedinesss of Praisse is sso eager, that he sswallows
  any Thing, that comes in the Likenesss of it, how notorious and

  Defences, but sstil by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif- fling
  Strain, without Regard of any Man, that sstands in the Way of his
  Pageant. Where he thinks he may do it ssafely, he will confidently own

  this means his Writings are, like a Taylor's Cusshion, of mossaic
  Work, made up of sseveral Scraps ssewed together, He calls a sslovenly
