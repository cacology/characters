<p>/ [Double Rule]/ / #Center A/ #Center FANTASTIC/ [Double line capital]Is one that wears his Feather on the Ins<em>ide/ of his Head. His Brain is like Quicks</em>ilver,/ apt to receive any Impres<em>s</em>ion, but retain none./ His Mind is made of changeable Stuff, that/ alters Colour with every Motion towards the/ Light. He is a Cormorant, that has but one/ Gut, devours every Thing greedily, but it runs/ through him immediately. He does not know/ s<em>o much as what he would be, and yet would/ be every Thing he knows. He is like a Paper-/ Lanthorn, that turns with the Smoak of a/ Candle. He wears his Cloaths, as the antient/ Laws of the Land have provided, according/ to his Quality, that he may be known what/ he is by them; and it is as eas</em>y to decipher/ him by his Habit as a [i] Pudding. He is rigg'd/ with Ribbon, and his Garniture is his Tackle;/ #Center K2/</p>

<p>132 #Center A FANTASTIC./ all the res<em>t of him is Hull. He is s</em>ure to be/ the earlies<em>t in the Fas</em>hion, as others are of/ a Faction, and glories as much to be in the/ Head of a Mode, as a Solider does to be in/ the Head of an Army. He is admirably s<em>kil-/ ful in the Mathematics of Cloaths; and can/ tell, at the firs</em>t View, whether they have the/ right Symmetry. He alters his Gate with the/ Times, and has not a Motion of his Body, that/ (like a Dottrel) he does not borrow from s<em>ome-/ body els</em>e. He exercis<em>es his Limbs, like the/ Pike and Mus</em>ket, and all his Pos<em>tures are prac-/ tis</em>ed--Take him all together, and he is nothing/ but a Trans<em>lation, Word for Word, out of/ [i] French, [i] an Image cas</em>t in Plas<em>ter of [i] Paris, [i] and/ a Puppet s</em>ent over for others to dres<em>s thems</em>elves/ by. He s<em>peaks [i] French, [i] as Pedants do [i] Latin, [i]/ to s</em>hew his Breeding; and mos<em>t naturally,/ where he is leas</em>t unders<em>tood. All his non-Na_/ turals, on which his Health and Dis</em>eases de-/ pend, are [i] s<em>tile novo. French [i] is his Holiday-Lan-/ guage, that he wears for his Pleas</em>ure and Or-/ nament, and us<em>es [i] English [i] only for his Bus</em>ines<em>s/ and neces</em>s<em>ary Occas</em>ions. He is like a [i] Scotch-/ man, [i] though he is born a Subject of his own/</p>

<p>Nation, he carries a [i] French [i] faction within/ him./ / #indent He is never quiet, but s<em>its as the Wind is/ s</em>aid to do, when it is mos<em>t in Motion. His/ Head is as full of Maggots as a Pas</em>toral Poet's/ Flock. He was begotten, like one of Pliny's/ Portugues<em>e Hors</em>es, by the Wind--The Truth/ is he ought not to have been reared; for being/ calved in the Increas<em>e of the Moon, he Head/ is troubled with a ---/ / N.H.
