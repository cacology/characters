<h1 id="a-lover">A<br />
LOVER</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S a Kind of <em>Goth</em> and <em>Vandal</em>, that leaves<br />
his native Self to ſettle in another, or a<br />
Planter that forſakes his Country, where he<br />
was born, to labour and dig in <em>Virginia</em>.<br />
His Heart is catched in a Net with a Pair of<br />
bringht ſhining Eyes, as Larks are with Pieces<br />
of a looking-Glaſs. He makes heavy Com_<br />
plaints againſt it for deſerting of him, and<br />
deſires to have another in Exchange for it,<br />
which is a very unreaſonable Requeſt ; for if<br />
it betrayed its boſom Friend, what will it do<br />
to a Stranger, that ſhould give it Truſt and<br />
Entertainment ? He binds himſelf, and cries<br />
out he is robbed of his Heart, and charges the<br />
Innocent with it, only to get a good Com-<br />
poſition, or another for it, againſt Con-<br />
ſcience and Honeſty. He talks much of his<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Flame, and pretends to be burnt by his Miſ-<br />
treſs’s Eyes, for which he requires Satisfaction<br />
from her, like one that ſets his Houſe on Fire<br />
to get a Brief for charitable Contributions.<br />
He makes his Miſtreſs all of Stars, and when<br />
ſhe is unkind, rails at them, as if they did ill<br />
Offices between them, and being of her Kin<br />
ſet her againſt him. He falls in Love as Men<br />
fall ſick when their Bodies are inclined to it,<br />
and imputes that to his Miſtreſſes Charms,<br />
which is really in his own Temper ; for when<br />
that is altered, the other vaniſhes of it ſelf, and<br />
therefore one ſaid not amiſs,</p>
<p>------The Lilly and the Roſe<br />
Not in her Cheeks, but in thy Temper grows.</p>
<p>When his Deſires are grown up, they ſwarm,<br />
and fly out to ſeek a new Habitation, and<br />
whereſoever they light they fix like Bees, among<br />
which ſome late Philoſophers have obſerved<br />
that it is a Female that leads all the reſt. Love<br />
is but a Clap of the Mind, a Kind of run-<br />
ning of the Fancy, that breaks out, if it be<br />
not ſtopped in Time, into Botches of heroic<br />
Rime ; for all Loverrs are poets for the Time<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>being, and make their Ladies a Kind of mo-<br />
ſaic Work of ſeveral coloured Stones joined<br />
together by a ſtrong Fancy, but very ſtiff and<br />
unnatural ; and though they ſteal Stars from<br />
Heaven, as <em>Prometheus</em> did Fire, to animate<br />
them, all will not make them alive, nor<br />
alives-liking.<br />
