He flies from the Place where he/ was hatched, like a Wildgoos<em>e, and prefers all/ others before it. He has no Quarrel to it, but/ becaus</em>e he was born in it, and like a Bas<em>tard,/ he is as</em>hamed of his Mother, becaus<em>e s</em>he is of/ him. He is a Merchant, that makes Voyages/ into foreign Nations, to drive a Trade in Wis<em>-/ dom and Politics, and is is not for his Credit/ to have it thoughts, he has made an ill Return,/ which mus</em>t be, if he s<em>hould allow of any of/ the Growth of his own Country. This makes/ him quick and blow up hims</em>elf with Admira-/ tion of foreign Parts, and a generous Con-/ tempt of Home, that all Men may admire, at/ leas<em>t, the means he has had of Improvement,/ and deplore their own Defects</em>. His Obs<em>erva-/ tions are like a Sieve, that lets the finer Flour/ pas</em>s, and retains only the Bran of Things;/</p>

He pities the little/ knowledge of Truth which thos<em>e have, that/ have not s</em>een the World abroad, forgetting,/ that at the s<em>ame time he tells us, how little/ Credit is to be given to his own Relations and/ thos</em>e of others, that s<em>peak and write of their/ Travels. He has worn his own Language to/ Rags, and patched it up with Scraps and Ends/ of foreign--This s</em>erves him for Wit, and they ap-/ plaud one another accordingly. He believes/ this Raggednes<em>s of his Dis</em>cours<em>e a great Demon-/ s</em>tration of the Improvement of his Knowledge ;/ as (i) Inns-of-Court (i) Men intimate their Proficiency/ in the Law by the Tatters of their Gowns-/ All the Wit he brought Home with him is like/ foreign Coin, of a bas<em>er Alloy than our own,/ and s</em>o will not pas<em>s here without great Los</em>s./ All noble Creatures, that are famous in any/ Vol. II #Center L/</p>

All he can s<em>ay for hims</em>elf is,/ his Mind was s<em>ick of a Cons</em>umption, and/ change of Air has cured him : For all his other/ Improvements have only been to eat in . . . ./ and talk with thos<em>e he did not unders</em>tand; to/ hold Intelligence with all Gazettes, and from/ the Sight of States<em>men in the Street unriddle/ the Intrigues of all their Councils, to make a/ wondrous Progres</em>s into Knowledge by riding/ with a Mes<em>s</em>enger, and advance In Politics by/ mounting of a Mule, run through all Sorts of/ Learning in a Waggon, and found all Depths/ of Arts in Felucca, ride pos<em>t into the Secrets/ of all States, and grow acquainted with their/ clos</em>e Des<em>igns in Inns and Hos</em>tleries; for cer-/ tainly there is great Virtue in Highways and/ Hedges to make an able Man, and a good/ Pros<em>pect cannot but let him s</em>ee far into Things./</p>
