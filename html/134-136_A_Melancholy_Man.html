<p>/ #Double Rule/ / #Center A/ #Center MELANCHOLY MAN/ / #[double line initial cap]Is one, that keeps the wors<em>t Company in the/ World, that is, his own; and tho' he be al-/ ways falling out and quarrelling with hims</em>elf,/ yet he has not power to endure any other Con-/ vers<em>ation. His Head is haunted, like a Hous</em>e,/ with evil Spirits and Apparitions, that terrify/ and fright him out of hims<em>elf, till he s</em>tands/ empty and fors<em>aken. His Sleeps and his Wa-/ kings are s</em>o much the s<em>ame, that he knows not/ how to dis</em>tinguis<em>h them, and many times/ when he dreams, he believes he is broad awake/ and s</em>ees Vis<em>ions. The Fumes and Vapours/ that ris</em>e from his Spleen and Hypocondries/ have s<em>o s</em>mutched and s<em>ullied his Brain (like a/ Room that s</em>moaks) that his Unders<em>tanding is/ blear-ey'd, and has no right Perception of any/ Thing. His Soul lives in his Body, like a/ Mole in the Earth, that labours in the Dark,/ and cas</em>ts up Doubts and Scruples of his own/</p>

<p>Imagination, to make that rugged and uneas<em>y,/ that was plain and open before. His Brain is/ s</em>o cracked, that he fancies hims<em>elf to be Glas</em>s,/ and is afraid that every Thing he comes near/ s<em>hould break him in Pieces. Whats</em>oever makes/ an Impres<em>s</em>ion in his Imagination works it s<em>elf/ in like a Screw, and the more he turns and/ winds it, the deeper it s</em>ticks, till it is never to/ be got out again. The Temper of his Brain/ being earthy, cold, and dry, is apt to breed/ Worms, that s<em>ink s</em>o deep into it, no Medicine/ in Art or Nature is able to reach them. He/ leads his Life, as one leads a Dog in a Slip/ that will not follow, but is dragged along until/ he is almos<em>t hanged, as he has it often under/ Cons</em>ideration to treat hims<em>elf in convenient/ Time and Place, if he can but catch hims</em>elf/ alone. After a long and mortal Feud between/ his inward and his outward Man, they at/ length agree to meet without Seconds, and decide the/ Quarrel, in which the one drops, and the/ other s<em>inks out fo the Way, and makes his/ Es</em>cape into s<em>ome foreign World, from whence/ is it never after heard of. He convers</em>es with/ nothing s<em>o much as his own Imagination,/ which being apt to mis</em>repres*ent Things to him,/ #Center K 4/</p>

[i] He/ makes the Infirmity of his Temper pas<em>s for/ Revelations, as [i] Mahomet [i] did by his falling/ Sicknes</em>s, and ins<em>pires hims</em>elf with the Wind/ of his own Hypocondries. He laments, like/ [i] Heraclitus [i] the Maudlin Philos<em>opher, at other/ Men's Mirth, and take Pleas</em>ures in nothing/ but his own un-s<em>ober Sadnes</em>s. His Mind is/ full of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like/ a Nes<em>t of Boxes. He s</em>leeps little, but dreams/ much, and s<em>oundes</em>t when he is waking. He/ s<em>ees Vis</em>ions further off than a s<em>econd-s</em>ighted/ Man in [i] Scotland, [i] and dreams upon a hard/ Point with admirable Judgement. He is jus<em>t/ s</em>o much wors<em>e than a Madman, as he is below/ him in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen/ the mos</em>t mad govern all the res*t, and receive/ a natural Obedience from their Inferiors./</p>
