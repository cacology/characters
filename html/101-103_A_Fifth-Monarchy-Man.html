<p>[<em>two rules</em>]/ / #A #FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN/ / / I<sup>2</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">S</span> one, that is not contented to be a Privy-/ Counſellor of the Kingdom of Heave, but/ would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,/ and tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the/ Kingdom of Earth. His Deſign is to make/ <em>Chriſt</em> King, as his Forefathers the <em>Jew</em> did,/ only to abuſe and crucify him, that he might/ ſhare his Lands and Goods, as he did his Vice-/ gerents here. He dreams of a Fool's Paradiſe/ without a Serpent in it, a golden Age all of/ Saints, and no Hypocrites, all <em>holy-Court</em> Princes,/ and no Subjects but the Wicked; a Govern-/ ment of <em>Perkin Warbec</em> and <em>Lambert Simnel</em>/ Saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it,/ might make himſelf a Price, and claim a/ Title to the Crown. He fancies a <em>fifth-Mo-/ narchy</em> as the Quinteſſence of all Governments,/ abſtracted from all Matter, and conſiſting/</p>
<hr />
<p>wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and Myſteries./ <em>John of Leyden</em> was the firſt Found of it, and/ though he miſcarried, like <em>Romulus</em> in a Tem-/ peſt, his Poſterity have Revelations every full/ Moon, that there may be a TIme to ſet up his/ Title again, and with better Succeſs; though/ his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had/ no ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,/ but their whole outward Men were ſet on the/ Gates of the City ; where a Head and four/ Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of the/ <em>fifth-Monarchy.</em> They have been contriving (ſince/ Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-/ ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed King/ <em>Oberon,</em> to erect their Monarchy in <em>Fairy-Land,</em>/ as being the moſt proper and natural Region in/ the whole World for their Government, and if/ it ſucceed there to proceed further. The <em>De-/ vil's</em> Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,/ and the Glory of them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,/ that they would venture their Necks to take/ him at his Word, and give him his Price./ Nothing comes ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-/ neſs as the <em>fifth-Monarchy,</em> that is no where/ to be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-/ thologies, and myſstical Riddles, like the Vi-/ ſions <em>Aeneas</em> ſaw in Hell of the <em>Roman</em> Empire,/</p>
<hr />
<p>Next this is the moſt reſembles <em>Mahomet's</em> Coming/ to the <em>Turks,</em> and King <em>Arthur's</em> Reign over the/ Britons in <em>Merlin</em>'s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin/ are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern/ the ſame Lineaments in them all. The poor/ Wicked are like to have a very ill time under/ them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-/ vernment, according to their ancient and fun-/ damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects/ but Slaves, who between them and the <em>Devil</em>/ are like to ſuffer Perſecution enough to make/ them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-/ ters. He gather Churches on the Sunday, as/ the <em>Jew</em> did Sitkcs on their Sabbath, to ſet the/ State on Fire. He humms and hahs high Trea-/ ſon, and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the/ Caſt they would throw. He groans Sedition,/ and, like the <em>Phariſee,</em> rails, when he gives/ Thanks. He interprets Propheſies, as <em>Whitting-/ ton</em> did the Bells, to ſpeak to him, and governs/ himſelf accordingly./</p>
