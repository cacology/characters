<p>[<em>two rules</em>]/ #AN/ #Astrologer/ / / I<sup>2</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">s</span> one that expounds upon the Planets, and/ teaches to conſtrue the <em>Accidents</em> by the <em>due/ joining of Stars in Conſtruction.</em> He talks with/ them by dumb Signs, and can tell what they/ mean by their twinckling, and ſquinting upon/ one another, as well as they themſelves. He/ is a Spy upon the Stars, and can tell what they/ are doing, by the Company they keep, and the/ Houſes they frequent. They have no Power to/ do any Thing alone, until ſo many meet, as/ will make a <em>Quorum.</em>He is Clerk of the Com-/ mittee to them, and draws up all their Orders,/ that concern either public or private Affairs./ He keeps all their Accompts for them, and/ ſums them up, not by <em>Debtor,</em> but by <em>Creditor</em>/ alone, a more compendious Way. They do/ ill to make them have ſo much Authority over/</p>
<hr />
<p>the Earth, which, perhaps, has as much as/ any one of them but the Sun, and as much/ Right to ſit and vote in their Councils, as any/ other : But becauſe there are but ſeven Electors/ of the <em>German</em> Empire, they will allow of no/ more to diſpoſe of all other ; and moſt fooliſhly/ and unnaturally depoſe their own Parent of its/ Inheritance; rather than acknowledge a Defect/ in their own Rules. Theſe Rules are all they/ have to ſhew for their Title ; and yet not one/ of them can tell whether thoſe they had them/ from came honeſtly by them. <em>Virgil's</em> Deſ-/ cription of <em>Fame,</em> that reaches from Earth/ to the Stars, <em>tam ficti pravique tenax,</em> to carry/ Lies and Knavery, will ſerve Aſtrologers with-/ out any ſenſible Variation. He is a Fortune-/ Seller, a Retailer of Deſtiny, and petty Chap-/ man to the Planets. He caſts Nativities as/ Gameſters do falſe Dice, and by ſlurring and/ palming <em>ſextile, quartile,</em> and <em>trine,</em> like <em>ſize,</em>/ <em>quater, trois,</em> can throw what chance he/ pleaſes. He ſets a Figure, as Cheats do a Main/ at Hazard ; and Gulls throw away their Money/ at it. He festches the Grounds of his Art ſo/ far off, as well from Reaſon, as the Stars, that,/ like a Traveller, he is allowed to lye by Au-/</p>
<hr />
<p>thority. And as Beggars, that have no Money/ themſelves, believe all others have, and beg/ of thoſe, that have as little as themſelves : So/ the ignorant Rabble believe in him, though/ he has no more Reaſon for what he profeſſes,/ than they./</p>
