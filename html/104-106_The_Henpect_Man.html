<h1 id="the-henpect-man">THE<br />
HENPECT MAN</h1>
<p>R<sup>2</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">ide</span> behind his Wife, and lets her<br />
wear the Spurs and governs the Reins. He<br />
is a Kind of prepoſterous Animal, that being<br />
curbed in goes with his Tail forwards. He is<br />
but ſubordinate and miniſterial to his Wife,<br />
who commands in chief, and he dares do no-<br />
thing without her Order. She takes Place of him,<br />
and he creeps in at the Bed's Feet, as if he had<br />
married the <em>Grand Seignor's</em> Daughter, and is<br />
under Correction of her Pantofle. He is his<br />
Wife's Villain, and has nothing of his own<br />
further than ſhe pleaſes to allow him. When<br />
he was married he promiſed to worſhip his<br />
Wife with his Soul inſtead of his Body, and<br />
endowed her among his worldly Goods with his<br />
Humanity. He changed Sexes with his Wife,<br />
and put off the old Man to put on the new<br />
Woman. She ſits as the Helm, and he does<br />
but tug like a Slave at the Oar. The little<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>Wit he has being held <em>in capite</em> has rendered all<br />
the reſt of his Concerments liable to Pupi-<br />
lage and Wardſhip, and his Wife has the<br />
Tuition of his during his or her Life; and<br />
he has no Power to do any Thing of himſelf,<br />
but by his Guardian. His Wife manages him<br />
and his Eſtate with equal Authority, and he<br />
lives under her aribtrary Government and Com-<br />
mand as his ſuperior Office. He is but a kind<br />
of Meſſuage and Tenement in the Occupation<br />
of his Wife. He and ſhe make up a Kind of<br />
Hermaphrodite, a Monſter, or which the one<br />
half is more than the whole; for he is the<br />
weaker Veſſel, and but his Wife's Helper. His<br />
Wife eſpouſed and took him to Huſband for<br />
better or worſe, and the laſt Word ſtands.<br />
He was meant to be his Wife's Head, but being<br />
ſet on at the wrong End ſhe makes him ſerve<br />
(like the Jeſuits Devil) for her Feet. He is her<br />
Province, an Acquiſition that ſhe took in,<br />
and gives Laws to at Indiſcretion; for being<br />
overmatched and too feeble for the Encounter,<br />
he was forced to ſubmit and take Quarter.<br />
He has inverted the Curſe, and turned it upon<br />
himſelf; for his Deſire is towards his Wife,<br />
and ſhe reign over him and with <em>Eſau</em> has<br />
ſold his Birthright for a Meſs of Matrimony.<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>His Wife took his Liberty among his worldly<br />
Goods, to have and to hold till Death them<br />
do part. He is but Groom of his Wife's<br />
Chamber, and her menial Huſband, that is<br />
always in waiting, and a Slave only in the Right<br />
of his Wife.<br />
