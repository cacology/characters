<h1 id="an-antiquary">AN<br />
ANTIQUARY</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>s one that has his Being in this Age, but<br />
his Life and Converſation is in the Days of<br />
old. He deſpiſes the preſent Age as an Inno-<br />
vation, and ſlights the future ; but has a great<br />
Value for that, which is paſt and gone, like<br />
the Madman, that fell in Love with <em>Cleopatra</em>.<br />
He is an old frippery-Philoſopher, that has<br />
ſo ſtrange a natural Affection to worm-eaten<br />
Speculation, that it is apparent he has a Worm<br />
in his Skull. He honours his Forefathers and<br />
Fore-mothers, but condemns his Parents as<br />
too modern, and no better than Upſtarts. He<br />
neglects himſelf, becauſe he was born in his<br />
own Time, and ſo far off Antiquity, which<br />
he ſo much admires ; and repines, like a<br />
younger Brother, becauſe he came ſo late into<br />
the World. He ſpends the one half of his<br />
Time in collecting old inſignificant Trifles,<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>and the other in ſhewing them, which he takes<br />
ſingular Delight in ; becauſe the oftener he does<br />
it, the further they are from being new to him.<br />
All his Curiouſities take place of one another<br />
according to their Seniority, and he values<br />
them not by their Abilities, but their Standing.<br />
He has a great Veneration for Words that are<br />
ſtricken in Years, and are grown ſo aged, that<br />
they have out-lived their Employments---Theſe<br />
he uſes with a Reſpect agreeable to their An-<br />
tiquity, and the good Services they have done.<br />
He throws away his Time in enquiring after<br />
that which is paſt and gone ſo many Ages ſince,<br />
like one that ſhoots away an Arrow, to find<br />
out another that was loſt before. He fetches<br />
things out of Duſt and Ruins, like the Fable<br />
of the chymical Plant raiſed out of its own<br />
Aſhes. He values one old Invention, that is<br />
loſt and never to be recovered, before all the<br />
new ones in the World, tho’ never ſo uſeful.<br />
The whole Buſineſs of his Life is the ſame with<br />
his, that ſhows the Tombs at <em>Westminster</em>, only<br />
the one does it for his Pleaſure, and the other<br />
for Money. As every Man has but one Fa-<br />
ther, but two Grand-Fathers and a World<br />
of Anceſtors ; ſo he has a proportional Value<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>for Things that are antient, and the further off<br />
the greater.</p>
<p>He is a great Time-ſerver, but it is of Time<br />
out of Mind, to which he conforms exactly,<br />
but is wholly retied from the preſent. His<br />
Days were ſpent and gone long before he came<br />
into the World, and ſince his only Buſineſs is<br />
to collect what he can out of the Ruins of<br />
them. He has ſo ſtrong a natural Affection to<br />
any Thing that is old, that he may truly <em>ſay to</em><br />
<em>Duſt and Worms you are my Father, and to Rot-</em><br />
<em>tenneſs thou are my Mother</em>. He has no Provi-<br />
dence nor Fore-ſight ; for all his Contempla-<br />
tions look backward upon the Days of old,<br />
and his Brains are turned with them, as if he<br />
walked backwards. He had rather interpret<br />
one obſcure Word in any old ſenſeleſs Diſ-<br />
courſe, than be the Author of the moſt ingenious<br />
new one ; and with <em>Scaliger</em> would ſell the<br />
Empire of <em>Germany</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> (if it were in his Power)<br />
for an old Song. He devours an old Manuſ-<br />
cript with greater Reliſh than Worms and Moths<br />
do, and, though there be nothing in it, values<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>it above any Thing printed, which he accounts<br />
but a Novelty. When he happens to cure a<br />
ſmall Botch in an old Author, he is as proud<br />
of it, as if he had got the Philoſophers Stone,<br />
and could cure all the Diſeaſes of Mankind.<br />
He values things wrongfully upon their Anti-<br />
quity, forgetting that the moſt modern are<br />
really the moſt ancient of all Things in the<br />
World, like thoſe that reckon their Pounds<br />
before their Shillings and Pence, of which they<br />
are made up. He eſteems no Cuſtoms but ſuch<br />
as have outlived themſelves, and are long ſince<br />
out of Uſe ; as the <em>Catholics</em> allow of no Saints,<br />
but ſuch as are dead, and the <em>Fanatics</em>, Op-<br />
poſition, of none but the Living.<br />
