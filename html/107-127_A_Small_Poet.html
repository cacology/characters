<p>[I]s one, that would fain make himself that, [ ]which {i} Nature{i} never meant him; like a {i}Fa- natic,{i} that insspires himsself with his own Whimsses. He ssets up Haberdassher of ssmall Poetry, with a very ssmall Stock, and no Credit. He believes it is Inventions enough to find out other Men's Wit; and whatssoever he lights upon either in Books, or Company, he makes bold with as his own. This he puts together sso un- towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit has the Rickets, by the Sswelling Dissproportion of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of him; him; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that he has catched of others; and his Flame like that of Charcoals that were burnt before : But as he wants Judgment to undersstand what is besst, he naturally takes the worsst, as being mosst agreeable to his own Talent. You may</p>

He is a perpetual Tal- ker; and you may know by the Freedom of his Disscoursse, that he came light by it, as Thieves sspend fiercely what they get. He meassures other Men's Wits by {i}their{i} Modessty, and his own by {i}his{i} Confidence. He makes nothing of writing Plays, becausse he has not Wit enough to un- derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-ture to talk and sscribble, as Chowsses do to play with cunning Gamessters, until they are cheated and laughed at. He is always talking of Wit, as thosse, that have bad Voices, are always ssing- ing out of Tune; and thosse, that cannot play, delight to fumble on Insstruments. He grows the unwisser by other Men's Harms; for the worsse others write, he finds the more Encou- ragement to do sso too. His Greedinesss of Praisse is sso eager, that he sswallows any Thing, that comes in the Likenesss of it, how notorious and palpable ssoever, and is as Shot-free againsst any Thing, that may lessssen his good Opinion</p>

<p>of himsself--This renders him incurable, like Disseasses, that grow inssensible.</p>
<p>If you disslike him it is at your own Peril; he is ssure to put in a Caveat beforehand againsst your Understanding; and, like a Malefac-tor in Wit, is always fursinssed with Exceptions against his Judges. This puts him upon perpe- tual Apologies, Excusses, and Defences, but sstil by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif- fling Strain, without Regard of any Man, that sstands in the Way of his Pageant. Where he thinks he may do it ssafely, he will confidently own other Men's Writings; and where he fears the Truth may be disscovered, he will by feeble Denials and feigned Inssinua- tions give Men Occassion to ssupposse sso.</p>
<p>If he undersstands [i] Latin [i] or [i] Greek [i] he ranks himsself among the Learned, desspisses the Igno- rant, talks Criticissms out of [i] Scaliger[i], and re- peats [i] Martial's [i] baudy Epigrams, and ssets up his Resst wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be not sso well qualified, he crys down all Learning as pedantic, dissclaims Study, and professsses to write with as great Facility, as if his Musse was</p>

Whatssoever he hears well ssaid he sseizes upon by poetical Licence; and one Way makes it his own, that is by ill repeating of it--This he believes to be no more Theft, than it is to take that, which others throw away. By this means his Writings are, like a Taylor's Cusshion, of mossaic Work, made up of sseveral Scraps ssewed together, He calls a sslovenly nassty Desscription [i] great Na- ture,[i] and dull Flatnesss [i] strange Eassiness.[i] He writes down all that comes in his Head, and makes no Choice, becausse he has nothing to do it with, that is Judgment. He is always repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like the [i] long Parliament [i] making [i] Ordinances [i] in their Stead; although they are perpetually [i] thrown out [i] of Coffee-Housses, and come to Nothing. He is like an [i]Italian [i] Thief, that never robs, but he murthers, to prevent Disscovery; sso ssure is he to cry down the Man from whom he pur- loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may passs unssusspec-ted. He is byt a Copier at besst, and will never arrive to prac-tice by the Life: For bar him the Imitation of ssomething he has read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.</p>

<p>Obs<em>ervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form of jus</em>t Wit, are above his Philos<em>ophy. He appears s</em>o over concerned in all Men's Wits, as if they were but Dis<em>paragements of his own; and crys down all they do, as if they were Encroachments upon him. He takes Jes</em>ts fromt he Owners and breaks them, as [i] Justices[i] do fals<em>e Weights, and Pots that want Meas</em>ure. When he meets with any Thing, that is very good, he change it into s<em>mall Money, like three Groats for a Shilling, to s</em>erve s<em>everal Occas</em>ions. He dis<em>claims Study, pretends to take Things in Motion, and to s</em>hoot flying, which appears to be very true by his often mis<em>s</em>ing of his Mark. His Wit is much troubled with Obs<em>truc_tions; and he has Fits as painful as thos</em>e of the Spleen. He fancies him- s<em>elf a dainty s</em>pruce Shepherd, with a Flock and a fine s<em>ilken Shepherds</em>s, that follows his Pipe, as Rats did the Conjurers in [i] Germany.[i]</p>
<p>As for [i] Epithets, [i] he always avoids those, that are near akin to the Sens<em>se. Such matches are unlawful, and not fit to be made by a [i] Chris</em>tian[i] Poet; and therefore all his Care is to chus*e out</p>

<p>For [i] Similtudes,[i] he likes the hardes<em>t and mos</em>t obs<em>cure bes</em>t: For as Ladies wear black Patches, to make their Complexions s<em>eem fairer than they are; s</em>o when an Illus<em>tration is more ob- s</em>cure than the Sens<em>e that went before it, it mus</em>t of Neces<em>s</em>ity make it appear clearer than it did: For Contraries are bes<em>t s</em>et off with Con- traries.</p>

He has found out a new Sort of poetical [i]Geor- gics, [i] a Trick of s<em>owing Wit like clover-gras</em>s on barren Subjec_ts, which would yield nothing before. This is very us<em>eful for the Times, wherein, s</em>ome men s<em>ay, there is no Room left for new Invention. He will take three Grains of Wit like the Elixir, and projec_ting it upon the [i] Iron-Age [i] turns it immediately into [i] Gold--[i] All the Bus</em>iness of Mankind has pres<em>ently vanis</em>hed, the whole World has kept Holiday; there has been no Men but Heroes and Poets, no Women but Nymphs and Shepherdes<em>s</em>es; Tress have born Fritters, and Rivers flowed Plum-Porrige.</p>

<p>it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine- pence. And as s<em>uch Cours</em>es brough the [i] prodigal Son [i] to eat with Hogs: So they did him to feed with Hors<em>es, which were not much better Company, and may teach us to avoid doing the like. For certainly it is more noble to take four or five Grains of Sens</em>e, and, like a Gold-Beater, hammer them into s*o many Leaves as will fill a whole Book; than to write nothing but Epitomes, which many wife Men believe will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.</p>
<p>When he writes, he commonly s<em>teers the Sens</em>e of his Lines by the Rhime that is at the End of them, as Butchers do Calves by the Tail. For when he has made one Line, which is eas<em>y enough; and has found out s</em>ome s<em>turdy hard Word, that will but rhime, he will ham- mer the Sens</em>e upon it, like a Piece of hot Iron upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleas*es.</p>
<p>There is no Art in the World s<em>o rich in Terms as Poetry; a whole Dic_tionary is s</em>carce</p>
<p>[i] So they did him to feed with Hors<em>es] This mus</em>t be explained by the s<em>ame Writer of [i] Virgil's[i] Life, who informs us that [Virgil] in his Youth s</em>tudied Phys<em>ic, in which having made great Proficiency, he repaired to [i] Rome, [i] and applying hims</em>elf to that Branch of it</p>

By this means s<em>mall Poets have s</em>uch a Stock of able hard Words lying by them, as [i] Dryades, Hamadryades, Aonides, Fauni, Nymphae, Sylvani, &amp;c.[i] that s<em>ignify nothing at all; and s</em>uch a World of pedantic Terms of the s<em>ame Kind, as may s</em>erve to furnis*h all the new Inventions and [i] thorough-Reformations, [i] that can happen between this and [i] Plato's[i] great Year.</p>
<p>When he writes he never proposes any Scope or Purpos<em>e to hims</em>elf, but gives h Genius all Freedom: For as he, that rides abroad for his Pleas<em>ure, can hardly be out of his Way; s</em>o he that writes for his Pleas<em>ure, can s</em>eldom be be- s<em>ide his Subjec_t. It is an ungrateful Thing to a noble Wit to be confined to any Thing--- To what Purpos</em>e did the Antients feign [i] Pegas<em>us to have Wings, if he mus</em>t be confined to the Road and Stages like a Pack-Hors*e, or be forced to be obedient to Hedges and Ditches?

<p>He'll take s<em>cant Piece of coars</em>e Sens<em>e, and s</em>tretch it on the Tenterhooks of half a s<em>core Rhimes, utnil it crack that you may s</em>ee through it, and it rattle like a Drum-Head.

<p>He'll make one Word of as many Joints, as the Tin-Pudding, that a Jugler pulls out of his Throat, and chops in again--What think you of [i] glud-fum-flam-hasta-minantes? [i] Some of the old [i] Latin [i] Poets bragged that their Vers<em>es were tougher than Bras</em>s, and harder than Marble; what would they have done, if they had s<em>een thes</em>e?
