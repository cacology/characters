<h1 id="a-bankrupt">A<br />
BANKRUPT</h1>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>S made by breaking, as a Bird is hatched<br />
by breaking the Shell, for he gains more<br />
by giving over his Trade, than ever he did by<br />
dealing in it. He drives a Trade, as <em>Oliver</em><br />
<em>Cromwel</em> did a Coach, till it broke in Pieces.<br />
He is very tender and careful in preſerving<br />
his Credit, and keeps it as methodically as a<br />
Race-nag is dieted, that in the End he may<br />
run away with it: for he observes a punctual<br />
Curioſity in performing his Word, until he<br />
has improved his Credit as far as it can go ;<br />
and then he has catched the Fiſh, and throws<br />
away the Net ; as a Butcher, when he has fed<br />
his Beaſt as fat as it can grow, cuts the Throat<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>of it. When he has brought his Deſign to<br />
Perfection, and diſpoſed of all his Materials,<br />
he lays his Train, like a Powder Traytor, and<br />
gets out of the way, while he blows up all<br />
thoſe that truſted him. After the Blow is<br />
given there is no Manner of Intelligence to be<br />
had of him for ſome Months, until the Rage<br />
and Fury is ſomewhat digeſted, and all Hopes<br />
vaniſhed of ever recovering any Thing of Body,<br />
or Goods, for Revenge, or Reſtitution ; and<br />
then Propoſitions of Treaty and Accommoda-<br />
tion appear, like the Sign of the <em>Hand and Pen</em><br />
out of the Clouds, with Conditions more un-<br />
reaſonable than Thieves are wont to demand<br />
for Reſtitution of ſtolen Goods. He ſhoots<br />
like a Fowler at a whole Flock of Geeſe at<br />
once, and ſtalks with his Horſe to come as near<br />
as poſſibly he can without being perceived by<br />
any one, or giving the leaſt Suſpicion of his<br />
Deſign, until it is too late to prevent it ; and<br />
then he flies from them, as they ſhould have<br />
done before from him. His Way is ſo com-<br />
monly uſed in the City, that he robs in a Road,<br />
like a Highwayman, and yet they will never<br />
arrive at Wit enough to avoid it ; for it is done<br />
</p>
<hr />
<p>upon Surpriſe ; and as Thieves are commonly<br />
better mounted than thoſe they rob, he very<br />
eaſily makes his Eſcape, and flies beyond Per-<br />
ſuit of Huon-cries, and there is no Poſſibility<br />
of overtaking him.<br />
