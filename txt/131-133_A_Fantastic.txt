CENTER FANTASTIC


[Double line capital]Is one that wears his Feather on the Ins_ide
of his Head. His Brain is like Quicks_ilver,
apt to receive any Impres_s_ion, but retain none.
His Mind is made of changeable Stuff, that
alters Colour with every Motion towards the
Light. He is a Cormorant, that has but one
Gut, devours every Thing greedily, but it runs
through him immediately. He does not know
s_o much as what he would be, and yet would
be every Thing he knows. He is like a Paper-
Lanthorn, that turns with the Smoak of a
Candle. He wears his Cloaths, as the antient
Laws of the Land have provided, according
to his Quality, that he may be known what
he is by them; and it is as eas_y to decipher
him by his Habit as a [i] Pudding. He is rigg'd
with Ribbon, and his Garniture is his Tackle;

all the res_t of him is Hull. He is s_ure to be
the earlies_t in the Fas_hion, as others are of
a Faction, and glories as much to be in the
Head of a Mode, as a Solider does to be in
the Head of an Army. He is admirably s_kil-
ful in the Mathematics of Cloaths; and can
tell, at the firs_t View, whether they have the
right Symmetry. He alters his Gate with the
Times, and has not a Motion of his Body, that
(like a Dottrel) he does not borrow from s_ome-
body els_e. He exercis_es his Limbs, like the
Pike and Mus_ket, and all his Pos_tures are prac-
tis_ed--Take him all together, and he is nothing
but a Trans_lation, Word for Word, out of
[i] French, [i] an Image cas_t in Plas_ter of [i] Paris, [i] and
a Puppet s_ent over for others to dres_s thems_elves
by. He s_peaks [i] French, [i] as Pedants do [i] Latin, [i]
to s_hew his Breeding; and mos_t naturally,
where he is leas_t unders_tood. All his non-Na_
turals, on which his Health and Dis_eases de-
pend, are [i] s_tile novo. French [i] is his Holiday-Lan-
guage, that he wears for his Pleas_ure and Or-
nament, and us_es [i] English [i] only for his Bus_ines_s
and neces_s_ary Occas_ions. He is like a [i] Scotch-
man, [i] though he is born a Subject of his own

Nation, he carries a [i] French [i] faction within
him.
#indent He is never quiet, but s_its as the Wind is
s_aid to do, when it is mos_t in Motion. His
Head is as full of Maggots as a Pas_toral Poet's
Flock. He was begotten, like one of Pliny's
Portugues_e Hors_es, by the Wind--The Truth
is he ought not to have been reared; for being
calved in the Increas_e of the Moon, he Head
is troubled with a ---
