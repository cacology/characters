one that expounds upon the Planets, and/ teaches to conſtrue the

have no Power to/ do any Thing alone, until ſo many meet, as/ will make
a <hi rendition="simple:italic">Quorum.</hi>He is Clerk of the Com-/

<p>the Earth, which, perhaps, has as much as/ any one of them but the

: But becauſe there are but ſeven Electors/ of the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">German</hi> Empire, they will allow of no/
more to diſpoſe of all other ; and moſt fooliſhly/ and unnaturally
depoſe their own Parent of its/ Inheritance; rather than acknowledge a
Defect/ in their own Rules. Theſe Rules are all they/ have to ſhew for
their Title ; and yet not one/ of them can tell whether thoſe they had
