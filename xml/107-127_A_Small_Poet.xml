<p>[I]s one, that would fain make himself that, [ ]which {i} Nature{i}
never meant him; like a {i}Fa- natic,{i} that insspires himsself with
his own Whimsses. He ssets up Haberdassher of ssmall Poetry, with a very
ssmall Stock, and no Credit. He believes it is Inventions enough to find
out other Men's Wit; and whatssoever he lights upon either in Books, or
Company, he makes bold with as his own. This he puts together sso un-
towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit has the Rickets, by the
Sswelling Dissproportion of the Joints. Imitation is the whole Sum of
him; him; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap, that he has catched of
others; and his Flame like that of Charcoals that were burnt before :
But as he wants Judgment to undersstand what is besst, he naturally
takes the worsst, as being mosst agreeable to his own Talent. You

and troublesome in him: For as thosse, that have Money but sseldom, are
always sshak- ing their Pockets, when they have it; sso does he, when he
thinks he has got ssomething, that will make him appear. He is a
perpetual Tal- ker; and you may know by the Freedom of his Disscoursse,
that he came light by it, as Thieves sspend fiercely what they get. He
meassures other Men's Wits by {i}their{i} Modessty, and his own by
{i}his{i} Confidence. He makes nothing of writing Plays, becausse he has
not Wit enough to un- derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-ture
to talk and sscribble, as Chowsses do to play with cunning Gamessters,
until they are cheated and laughed at. He is always talking of Wit, as
thosse, that have bad Voices, are always ssing- ing out of Tune; and
thosse, that cannot play, delight to fumble on Insstruments. He grows
the unwisser by other Men's Harms; for the worsse others write, he finds
the more Encou- ragement to do sso too. His Greedinesss of Praisse is
sso eager, that he sswallows any Thing, that comes in the Likenesss of
it, how notorious and palpable ssoever, and is as Shot-free againsst any
Thing, that may lessssen his good Opinion</p>

<p>of himsself--This renders him incurable, like Disseasses, that grow
inssensible.</p>
<p>If you disslike him it is at your own Peril; he is ssure to put in a
Caveat beforehand againsst your Understanding; and, like a Malefac-tor
in Wit, is always fursinssed with Exceptions against his Judges. This
puts him upon perpe- tual Apologies, Excusses, and Defences, but sstil
by Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif- fling Strain, without Regard of
any Man, that sstands in the Way of his Pageant. Where he thinks he may
do it ssafely, he will confidently own other Men's Writings; and where
he fears the Truth may be disscovered, he will by feeble Denials and
feigned Inssinua- tions give Men Occassion to ssupposse sso.</p>
<p>If he undersstands [i] Latin [i] or [i] Greek [i] he ranks himsself
among the Learned, desspisses the Igno- rant, talks Criticissms out of
[i] Scaliger[i], and re- peats [i] Martial's [i] baudy Epigrams, and
ssets up his Resst wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be not sso well
qualified, he crys down all Learning as pedantic, dissclaims Study, and
professsses to write with as great Facility, as if his Musse was</p>

hears well ssaid he sseizes upon by poetical Licence; and one Way makes
it his own, that is by ill repeating of it--This he believes to be no
more Theft, than it is to take that, which others throw away. By this
means his Writings are, like a Taylor's Cusshion, of mossaic Work, made
up of sseveral Scraps ssewed together, He calls a sslovenly nassty
Desscription [i] great Na- ture,[i] and dull Flatnesss [i] strange
Eassiness.[i] He writes down all that comes in his Head, and makes no
Choice, becausse he has nothing to do it with, that is Judgment. He is
always repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like the [i] long
Parliament [i] making [i] Ordinances [i] in their Stead; although they
are perpetually [i] thrown out [i] of Coffee-Housses, and come to
Nothing. He is like an [i]Italian [i] Thief, that never robs, but he
murthers, to prevent Disscovery; sso ssure is he to cry down the Man
from whom he pur- loins, that his petty Larceny of Wit may passs
unssusspec-ted. He is byt a Copier at besst, and will never arrive to
prac-tice by the Life: For bar him the Imitation of ssomething he has
read, and he has no Image in his Thoughts.</p>

<p>Obs<hi rendition="simple:italic">ervation and Fancy, the Matter and

Philos<hi rendition="simple:italic">ophy. He appears s</hi>o over
concerned in all Men's Wits, as if they were but
Dis<hi rendition="simple:italic">paragements of his own; and crys down
all they do, as if they were Encroachments upon him. He takes Jes</hi>ts
fromt he Owners and breaks them, as [i] Justices[i] do
fals<hi rendition="simple:italic">e Weights, and Pots that want

it into s<hi rendition="simple:italic">mall Money, like three Groats for

Occas</hi>ions. He dis<hi rendition="simple:italic">claims Study,
pretends to take Things in Motion, and to s</hi>hoot flying, which
appears to be very true by his often
mis<hi rendition="simple:italic">s</hi>ing of his Mark. His Wit is much
troubled with Obs<hi rendition="simple:italic">truc_tions; and he has
