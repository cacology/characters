  <head>A<lb />SMALL POET</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>S one, that would fain
  make himſelf that,<lb />which
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Nature</hi> never meant him ; like a
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fa-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">natic</hi>,
  that inſpires himſelf with his own<lb />Whimſies. He ſets up
  Haberdaſher of ſmall<lb />Poetry, with a very ſmall Stock, and no
  Credit.<lb />He believes it is Invention enough to find out<lb />other
  Men’s Wit ; and whatſoever he lights upon<lb />either in Books, or
  Company, he makes bold<lb />with as his own. This he puts together ſo
  un-<lb />towardly, that you may perceive his own Wit<lb />has the
  Rickets, by the ſwelling Diſproportion<lb />of the Joints. Imitation
  is the whole Sum of<lb />him ; and his Vein is but an Itch or Clap,
  that<lb />he has catched of others ; and his Flame like<lb />that of
  Charcoals, that were burnt before :<lb />But as he wants Judgment to
  underſtand what<lb />is beſt, he naturally takes the worſt, as
  being<lb />moſt agreeable to his own Talent. You may<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>know his Wit not to be natural, ’tis ſo un-<lb />quiet and
  troubleſome in him : For as thoſe,<lb />that have Money but ſeldom,
  are always ſhak-<lb />ing their Pockets, when they have it ; ſo
  does<lb />he, when he thinks he has got ſomething, that<lb />will make
  him appear. He is a perpetual Tal-<lb />ker ; and you may know by the
  Freedom of his<lb />Diſcourſe, that he came light by it, as
  Thieves<lb />ſpend freely what they get. He meaſures other<lb />Men’s
  Wits by <hi rendition="simple:italic">their</hi> Modeſty, and his own
  by<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">his</hi> Confidence. He makes
  nothing of writing<lb />Plays, becauſe he has not Wit enough to
  un-<lb />derstand the Difficulty. This makes him ven-<lb />ture to
  talk and ſcribble, as Chowſes do to play<lb />with cunning Gameſters,
  until they are cheated<lb />and laughed at. He is always talking of
  Wit,<lb />as thoſe, that have bad Voices, are always ſing-<lb />ing
  out of Tune ; and thoſe, that cannot play,<lb />delight to fumble on
  Inſtruments. He grows<lb />the unwiſer by other Men’s Harms ; for
  the<lb />worſe others write, he finds the more Encou-<lb />ragement to
  do ſo too. His Greedineſs of<lb />Praiſe is ſo eager, that he ſwallows
  any Thing,<lb />that comes in the Likeneſs of it, how
  notorious<lb />and palpable ſoever, and is as Shot-free
  againſt<lb />any Thing, that may leſſen his good Opinion<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>of himſelf---This renders him incurable, like<lb />Diſeaſes, that
  grow inſenſible.</p>
  <p>If you diſlike him it is at your own Peril ;<lb />he is ſure to put
  in a Caveat beforehand againſt<lb />your Understanding ; and, like a
  Malefactor<lb />in Wit, is always furniſhed with
  Exceptions<lb />againſt his Judges. This puts him upon
  perpe-<lb />tual Apologies, Excuſes, and Defences, but<lb />ſtill by
  Way of Defiance, in a Kind of whif-<lb />fling Strain, without Regard
  of any Man,<lb />that ſtands in the Way of his Pageant.<lb />Where he
  thinks he may do it ſafely, he<lb />will confidently own other Men’s
  Writings ;<lb />and where he fears the Truth may be
  diſcovered,<lb />he will by feeble Denials and feigned
  Inſinua-<lb />tions give Men Occaſion to ſuppoſe ſo.</p>
  <p>If he underſtands <hi rendition="simple:italic">Latin</hi> or
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Greek</hi> he ranks<lb />himſelf among
  the Learned, deſpiſes the Igno-<lb />rant, talks Criticiſms out of
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Scaliger</hi>, and re-<lb />peats
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Martial</hi>'s baudy Epigrams, and ſets
  up<lb />his Reſt wholly upon Pedantry. But if he be<lb />not ſo well
  qualified, he crys down all Learning<lb />as pedantic, diſclaims
  Study, and profeſſes to<lb />write with as great Facility, as if his
  Muſe was<lb /></p>

    [<hi rendition="simple:italic">footnote cont. next

  </note> he ſeizes upon by poetical Licence ;<lb />and one Way makes it
  his own, that is by ill<lb />repeating of it---This he believes to be
  no<lb />more Theft, than it is to take that, which others<lb />throw
  away. By this means his Writings are,<lb />like a Taylor’s Cuſhion, of
  moſaic Work,<lb />made up of ſeveral Scraps ſewed together.<lb />He
  calls a ſlovenly naſty Deſcription <hi rendition="simple:italic">great
  Na-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">ture</hi>, and dull
  Flatneſs <hi rendition="simple:italic">strange Eaſineſs</hi>.
  He<lb />writes down all that comes in his Head, and<lb />makes no
  Choice, becauſe he has nothing to<lb />do it with, that is Judgment.
  He is always<lb />repealing the old Laws of Comedy, and like<lb />the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">long Parliament</hi> making
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Ordinances</hi> in their<lb />Stead ;
  although they are perpetually
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">thrown</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">out</hi>
  of Coffee-Houſes, and come to Nothing.<lb />He is like an
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Italian</hi> Thief, that never
  robs,<lb />but he murthers, to prevent Diſcovery ; ſo ſure<lb />is he
  to cry down the Man from whom he pur-<lb />loins, that his petty
  Larceny of Wit may paſs<lb />unſuſpected. He is but a Copier at beſt,
  and<lb />will never arrive to practice by the Life : For<lb />bar him
  the Imitation of ſomething he has<lb />read, and he has no Image in
  his Thoughts.</p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>Obſervation and Fancy, the Matter and Form<lb />of juſt Wit, are
  above his Philoſophy. He<lb />appears ſo over concerned in all Men’s
  Wits,<lb />as if they were but Diſparagements of his<lb />own ; and
  crys down all they do, as if they<lb />were Encroachments upon him. He
  takes<lb />Jeſts from the Owners and breaks them,
  as<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Justices</hi> do falſe Weights,
  and Pots that want<lb />Meaſure. When he meets with any
  Thing,<lb />that is very good, he changes it into ſmall<lb />Money,
  like three Groats for a Shilling, to<lb />ſerve ſeveral Occaſions. He
  diſclaims Study,<lb />pretends to take Things in Motion, and to
  ſhoot<lb />flying, which appears to be very true by his<lb />often
  miſſing of his Mark. His Wit is much<lb />troubled with Obſtructions ;
  and he has Fits as<lb />painful as thoſe of the Spleen. He fancies
  him-<lb />ſelf a dainty ſpruce Shepherd, with a Flock and<lb />a fine
  ſilken Shepherdeſs, that follows his Pipe,<lb />as Rats did the
  Conjurers in <hi rendition="simple:italic">Germany</hi>.</p>
  <p>As for <hi rendition="simple:italic">Epithets</hi>, he always
  avoids thoſe, that<lb />are near akin to the Senſse. Such matches
  are<lb />unlawful, and not fit to be made by a
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſtian</hi><lb />Poet ; and therefore
  all his Care is to chuſe out<lb />[^2]:

  <p>ſuch, as will ſerve, like a wooden Leg, to piece<lb />out a main’d
  Verſe, that wants a Foot or two ;<lb />and if they will but rhimes now
  and then into<lb />the Bargain, or run upon a Letter, it is a
  Work<lb />of Supererrogation.</p>
  <p>For <hi rendition="simple:italic">Similitudes</hi>, he likes the
  hardeſt and moſt<lb />obſcure beſt : For as Ladies wear black
  Patches,<lb />to make their Complexions ſeem fairer than<lb />they
  are ; ſo when an Illuſtration is more ob-<lb />ſcure than the Senſe
  that went before it, it muſt<lb />of Neceſſity make it appear clearer
  than it<lb />did : For Contraries are beſt ſet off with
  Con-<lb />traries.</p>
  <p>He has found out a Way to ſave the Expence<lb />of much Wit and
  Senſe : For he will make<lb />leſs than ſome have prodigally laid out
  upon<lb />five or ſix Words ſerve forty or fifty Lines.<lb />This is a
  thrifty Invention, and very eaſy ; and,<lb />if it were commonly
  known, would much in-<lb />creaſe the Trade of Wit, and maintain a
  Mul-</p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>titude of ſmall Poets in conſtant Employment.<lb />He has found out
  a new Sort of poetical
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Geor-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">gics</hi>,
  a Trick of ſowing Wit like clover-graſs<lb />on barren Subjects, which
  would yield nothing<lb />before. This is very uſeful for the
  Times,<lb />wherein, ſome Men ſay, there is no Room left<lb />for new
  Invention. He will take three Grains<lb />of Wit like the Elixir, and
  projecting it upon<lb />the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Iron-Age</hi> turn it immediately into
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Gold---</hi><lb />All the Buſineſs of
  Mankind has preſently<lb />vaniſhed, the whole World has kept

    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Seneca</hi> in his 86th<lb />Epiſtle
    finds ſeveral Faults with
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Virgil</hi>'s Rules and Obſervations
    in<lb />Huſbandry, as they are delivered in his
    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Georgics</hi>, and adds of him
    ---<lb />“ Qui non quod veriſſime, ſed quid decentiſſime diceretur,
    ad-<lb />“ ſpexit ; nec Agricolas docere voluit, ſed legentes

  <p>it was no better than bringing a Noble to Nine-<lb />pence. And as

    <p><hi rendition="simple:italic">So they did him to feed with

    <hi rendition="simple:italic">Virgil</hi>’s Life, who informs us,
    that <hi rendition="simple:italic">Virgil</hi> in<lb />his Youth
    ſtudied Phyſic, in which having made great Proficiency,<lb />he
    repaired to <hi rendition="simple:italic">Rome</hi>, and applying
    himſelf to that Branch of it [<hi rendition="simple:italic">footnote
    cont. next page</hi>][^6]</p>
  </note> which were not much<lb />better Company, and may teach us to
  avoid<lb />doing the like. For certainly it is more noble<lb />to take
  four or five Grains of Senſe, and, like<lb />a Gold-Beater, hammer
  them into ſo many<lb />Leaves as will fill a whole Book ; than to
  write<lb />nothing but Epitomies, which many wiſe Men<lb />believe
  will be the Bane and Calamity of Learning.</p>
  <p>When he writes, he commonly ſteers the<lb />Senſe of his Lines by
  the Rhime that is at the<lb />End of them, as Butchers do Calves by
  the<lb />Tail. For when he has made one Line, which<lb />is eaſy
  enough ; and has found out ſome ſturdy<lb />hard Word, that will but
  rhime, he will ham-<lb />mer the Senſe upon it, like a Piece of hot
  Iron<lb />upon an Anvil, into what Form he pleaſes.</p>
  <p>There is no Art in the World ſo rich in<lb />Terms as Poetry ; a
  whole Dictionary is ſcarce</p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>able to contain them : For there is hardly a<lb />Pond, a
  Sheep-walk, or a Gravel-pit in
  all<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Greece</hi>, but the antient
  Name of it is become<lb />a Term of Art in Poetry. By this means
  ſmall<lb />Poets have ſuch a Stock of able hard Words lying<lb />by
  them, as <hi rendition="simple:italic">Dryades</hi>,
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Hamadryades</hi>,
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Aonides</hi>,
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fauni</hi>,<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Nymphae</hi>,
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Sylvani</hi>,
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">&amp;c</hi>. that ſignify nothing at
  all ;<lb />and ſuch a World of pedantic Terms of the<lb />ſame Kind,
  as may ſerve to furniſh all the new<lb />Inventions and
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">thorough-Reformations</hi>, that
  can<lb />happen between this and
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Plato</hi>’s great Year.</p>
  <p>When he writes he never propoſes any Scope<lb />or Purpoſe to
  himſelf, but gives his Genius all<lb />Freedom : For as he, that rides
  abroad for his<lb />Pleaſure, can hardly be out of his Way ; ſo
  he<lb />that writes for his Pleaſure, can ſeldom be be-<lb />ſide his
  Subject. It is an ungrateful Thing to<lb />a noble Wit to be confined
  to any Thing---<lb />To what Purpoſe did the Antients feign
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Pegaſus</hi><lb />to have Wings, if he
  muſt be confined to the<lb />Road and Stages like a Pack-Horſe, or be

  <p>fore he has no Reſpect to Decorum and Pro-<lb />priety of

  <p>He’ll take ſcant Piece of coarſe Senſe, and<lb />ſtretch it on the
  Tenterhooks of half a ſcore<lb />Rhimes, until it crack that you may
