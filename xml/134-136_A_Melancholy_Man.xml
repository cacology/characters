  <p>/ #Double Rule/ / #Center A/ #Center MELANCHOLY MAN/ / #[double
  line initial cap]Is one, that keeps the
  wors<hi rendition="simple:italic">t Company in the/ World, that is,
  his own; and tho' he be al-/ ways falling out and quarrelling with
  hims</hi>elf,/ yet he has not power to endure any other Con-/
  vers<hi rendition="simple:italic">ation. His Head is haunted, like a
  Hous</hi>e,/ with evil Spirits and Apparitions, that terrify/ and
  fright him out of hims<hi rendition="simple:italic">elf, till he
  s</hi>tands/ empty and fors<hi rendition="simple:italic">aken. His
  Sleeps and his Wa-/ kings are s</hi>o much the
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ame, that he knows not/ how to
  dis</hi>tinguis<hi rendition="simple:italic">h them, and many times/
  when he dreams, he believes he is broad awake/ and s</hi>ees
  Vis<hi rendition="simple:italic">ions. The Fumes and Vapours/ that
  ris</hi>e from his Spleen and Hypocondries/ have
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">o s</hi>mutched and
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ullied his Brain (like a/ Room that
  s</hi>moaks) that his Unders<hi rendition="simple:italic">tanding is/
  blear-ey'd, and has no right Perception of any/ Thing. His Soul lives
  in his Body, like a/ Mole in the Earth, that labours in the Dark,/ and
  cas</hi>ts up Doubts and Scruples of his own/</p>

  <p>Imagination, to make that rugged and
  uneas<hi rendition="simple:italic">y,/ that was plain and open before.
  His Brain is/ s</hi>o cracked, that he fancies
  hims<hi rendition="simple:italic">elf to be Glas</hi>s,/ and is afraid
  that every Thing he comes near/ s<hi rendition="simple:italic">hould
  break him in Pieces. Whats</hi>oever makes/ an
  Impres<hi rendition="simple:italic">s</hi>ion in his Imagination works
  it s<hi rendition="simple:italic">elf/ in like a Screw, and the more
  he turns and/ winds it, the deeper it s</hi>ticks, till it is never
  to/ be got out again. The Temper of his Brain/ being earthy, cold, and
  dry, is apt to breed/ Worms, that s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ink
  s</hi>o deep into it, no Medicine/ in Art or Nature is able to reach
  them. He/ leads his Life, as one leads a Dog in a Slip/ that will not
  follow, but is dragged along until/ he is
  almos<hi rendition="simple:italic">t hanged, as he has it often under/
  Cons</hi>ideration to treat hims<hi rendition="simple:italic">elf in
  convenient/ Time and Place, if he can but catch hims</hi>elf/ alone.
  After a long and mortal Feud between/ his inward and his outward Man,
  they at/ length agree to meet without Seconds, and decide the/
  Quarrel, in which the one drops, and the/ other
  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">inks out fo the Way, and makes his/
  Es</hi>cape into s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ome foreign World,
  from whence/ is it never after heard of. He convers</hi>es with/
  nothing s<hi rendition="simple:italic">o much as his own Imagination,/
  which being apt to mis</hi>repres*ent Things to him,/ #Center K 4/</p>

  s<hi rendition="simple:italic">omething els</hi>e/ than it is, and
  that he holds Intelligence with/ Spirits, that reveal
  whats<hi rendition="simple:italic">oever he fancies to/ him, as the
  antient rude People, that firs</hi>t heard/ their own Voices repeated
  by Echoes in the/ Woods, concluded it

  Inhabitants of thos<hi rendition="simple:italic">e s</hi>olitary
  Places,/ which they after believed to be Gods, and/ called them [i]
  Sylvans, Fauns, [i] and [i] Dryads. [i] He/ makes the Infirmity of his
  Temper pas<hi rendition="simple:italic">s for/ Revelations, as [i]
  Mahomet [i] did by his falling/ Sicknes</hi>s, and
  ins<hi rendition="simple:italic">pires hims</hi>elf with the Wind/ of
  his own Hypocondries. He laments, like/ [i] Heraclitus [i] the Maudlin
  Philos<hi rendition="simple:italic">opher, at other/ Men's Mirth, and
  take Pleas</hi>ures in nothing/ but his own
  un-s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ober Sadnes</hi>s. His Mind is/ full
  of Thoughts, but they are all empty, like/ a
  Nes<hi rendition="simple:italic">t of Boxes. He s</hi>leeps little,
  but dreams/ much, and s<hi rendition="simple:italic">oundes</hi>t when
  he is waking. He/ s<hi rendition="simple:italic">ees Vis</hi>ions
  further off than a s<hi rendition="simple:italic">econd-s</hi>ighted/
  Man in [i] Scotland, [i] and dreams upon a hard/ Point with admirable
  Judgement. He is jus<hi rendition="simple:italic">t/ s</hi>o much
  wors<hi rendition="simple:italic">e than a Madman, as he is below/ him
  in Degree of Frenzy; for among Madmen/ the mos</hi>t mad govern all
