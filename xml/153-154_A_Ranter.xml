<p>[<hi rendition="simple:italic">two rules</hi>]/ / #A RANTER/ / /
I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>s a
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Fanatic</hi> Hector, that has found out by
a very ſtrange Way of new Light, how to transform all the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Devils</hi> into
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Angels of Light</hi> ; for he believes all
Religion conſiſts in Looſeneſs, and that Sin and Vice is
<hi rendition="simple:italic">the whole Duty of Man</hi>. He puts off
the <hi rendition="simple:italic">old Man</hi>, but puts it on again
upon the <hi rendition="simple:italic">new one,</hi> and makes his
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Pagan</hi> Vices ſerve to preſerve his
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſtian</hi> Virtues from wearing out ;
for if he ſhould uſe his Piety and Devotion al- ways it would hold out
but a little while. He is loth that Iniquity and Vice ſhould be thrown
away, as long as there may be good Uſe of it ; for if that, which is
wickedly gotten, may be diſposed to pious Uſes, why ſhould not
Wickedneſs itſelf as well? He believes himſelf Shot-free againſt all the
Attempts of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Devil,</hi> the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">World,</hi> and the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Flesh,</hi> and therefore is not afraid to
attack them in their own Quarters, and encounter them at their own
Weapons.</p>

<p>For as ſtrong Bodies may freely venture to do,/ and ſuffer that,
without any Hurt to them-/ ſelves, which would deſtroy thoſe that are/
feeble: So a Saint, that is ſtrong in Grace,/ may boldly engage himſelf
in thoſe great Sins/ and Iniquities, that would eaſily damn a weak/
Brother, and yet come off never the worſe./ He believes Deeds of
Darkneſs to be only thoſe/ Sins that are committed in private, not
thoſe/ that are acted openly and owned. He is but/ an
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hypocrite</hi> turned the wrong Side
outward ;/ for, as the one wears his Vices within, and/ the other
without, ſo when they are counter-/ changed the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Ranter</hi> becomes an
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hypocrite,</hi> and/ the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Hypocrite</hi> an able
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Ranter.</hi> His Church is/ the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Devil's</hi> Chappel ; for it agrees
exactly both/ in Doctorine and Diſicipline with the beſt reform-/ ed
Baudy-Houſes. He is a Monſter produced/ by the Madneſs of this latter
Age ; but if it/ had been his Fate to have been whelped in old/
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Rome</hi> he had paſt for a Prodigy, and
been re-/ ceived among raining of Stones and the ſpeak-/ ing of Bulls,
and would have put a ſtop to all/ public Affairs, until he had been
expiated./ <hi rendition="simple:italic">Nero</hi> cloathed
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſtians</hi> in the Skins of wild/
Beaſts ; but he wraps wild Beaſts in the Skins/ of
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſtians</hi>./</p>
