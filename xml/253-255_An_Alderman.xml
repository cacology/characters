  <head>AN<lb />ALDERMAN</head>
  <p>H<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>AS taken his Degree in
  Cheating, and<lb />the higheſt of his Faculty ; or paid
  for<lb />refuſing his <hi rendition="simple:italic">MANDAMUS</hi>. He
  is a Peer of the<lb />City, and a Member of their upper
  Houſe,<lb />Who, as ſoon as he arrives at ſo many
  thouſand<lb />Pounds, is bound by the Charter to ſerve the<lb />Public
  with ſo much Underſtanding, what<lb />ſhift ſoever he make to raiſe
  it, and wear a<lb />Chain about his Neck like a Raindeer, or
  in<lb />Default to commute, and make Satisfaction in<lb />ready Money,
  the beſt Reaſon of the Place;<lb />for which hi has the Name only,
  like a titular<lb />Prince, and is an
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Alderman extraordinary</hi>. But<lb />if
  his Wife can prevail with him to ſtand, he<lb />becomes one of the
  City-ſupporters, and, like<lb />the Unicorn in the King's Arms, wears
  a Chain<lb />about his Neck very right-worſhipfully. He<lb />wears
  Scarlet, as the Whore of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Babylon</hi>
  does,<lb />not for her honeſty, but the Rank and Quality<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>ſhe is of among the Wicked, When he ſits<lb />as a Judge in his
  Court he is abſolute, and uſes<lb />arbitrary Power ; for he is not
  bound to un-<lb />derſtand what he does, nor render an
  Account<lb />why he gives Judgment on one Side rather<lb />than
  another ; but his Will is ſufficient to ſtand<lb />for his Reaſon, to
  all Intents and Purpoſes.<lb />He does no public Buſineſs without
  eating and<lb />drinking, and never meets about Matters of
  Im-<lb />portance, but the Cramming his Inſide is the<lb />moſt
  weighty Part of the Work of the Day.<lb />He diſpatches no public
  Affair until he has<lb />thoroughly dined upon it, and is fully
  ſatisfied<lb />with Quince-Pye and Cuſtard : for Men are<lb />wiſer,
  the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Italians</hi> ſay, after their
  Bellies are<lb />full, than when they are faſting, and he is
  very<lb />cautious to omit no Occaſion of improving his<lb />Parts
  that Way. He is ſo careful of the In-<lb />tereſt of his Belly, and
  manages it ſo induſ-<lb />triouſly, that in a little Space it grows
  great<lb />and takes Place of all the reſt of his Members,<lb />and
  becomes ſo powerful, that they will never<lb />be in a Condition to
  rebel againſt it any more.<lb />He is cloathed in Scarlet the Livery
  of his Sins,<lb />like the rich Glutton, to put him in Mind
  of<lb />what Means he came to his Wealth and Pre-<lb />ferment by. He
  makes a Trade of his Eat-<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>ing, and, like a Cock, ſcrapes when he feeds ;<lb />for the Public
  pays for all and more, which he<lb />and his Brethren ſhare among
  themſelves ; for<lb />they never make a dry Reckoning. When
  he<lb />comes to be Lord-Mayor he does not keep a<lb />great Houſe,
  but a very great Houſe-warming<lb />for a whole Year ; for though he
  invites all the<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Companies</hi> in
  the City he does not treat them,<lb />but they club to entertain him,
  and pay the<lb />Reckoning beforehand. His Fur-gown makes<lb />him
  look a great deal bigger than he is, like<lb />the Feathers of an Owl,
  and when he pulls<lb />it off, he looks as if he were fallen away,
  or<lb />like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.<lb /></p>
