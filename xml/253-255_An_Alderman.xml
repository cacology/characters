ALDERMAN<lb /><lb />[<hi rendition="simple:italic">two line
initial</hi>]HAS taken his Degree in Cheating,
and<lb />[<hi rendition="simple:italic">two line initial</hi>] the
higheſt of his Faculty ; or paid for<lb />refuſing his
<hi rendition="simple:italic">MANDAMUS</hi>. He is a Peer of
the<lb />City, and a Member of their upper Houſe,<lb />Who, as ſoon as
he arrives at ſo many thouſand<lb />Pounds, is bound by the Charter to
ſerve the<lb />Public with ſo much Underſtanding, what<lb />ſhift ſoever
he make to raiſe it, and wear a<lb />Chain about his Neck like a
Raindeer, or in<lb />Default to commute, and make Satisfaction
in<lb />ready Money, the beſt Reaſon of the Place;<lb />for which hi has
the Name only, like a titular<lb />Prince, and is an
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Alderman extraordinary</hi>. But<lb />if
his Wife can prevail with him to ſtand, he<lb />becomes one of the
City-ſupporters, and, like<lb />the Unicorn in the King's Arms, wears a
Chain<lb />about his Neck very right-worſhipfully. He<lb />wears
Scarlet, as the Whore of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Babylon</hi>
does,<lb />not for her honeſty, but the Rank and Quality<lb /><lb /></p>

<p>ſhe is of among the Wicked, When he ſits as a Judge in his Court he
is abſolute, and uſes arbitrary Power ; for he is not bound to un-
derſtand what he does, nor render an Account why he gives Judgment on
one Side rather than another ; but his Will is ſufficient to ſtand for
his Reaſon, to all Intents and Purpoſes. He does no public Buſineſs
without eating and drinking, and never meets about Matters of Im-
portance, but the Cramming his Inſide is the moſt weighty Part of the
Work of the Day. He diſpatches no public Affair until he has thoroughly
dined upon it, and is fully ſatisfied with Quince-Pye and Cuſtard : for
Men are wiſer, the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Italians</hi> ſay,
after their Bellies are full, than when they are faſting, and he is very
cautious to omit no Occaſion of improving his Parts that Way. He is ſo
careful of the In- tereſt of his Belly, and manages it ſo induſ-
triouſly, that in a little Space it grows great and takes Place of all
the reſt of his Members, and becomes ſo powerful, that they will never
be in a Condition to rebel againſt it any more. He is cloathed in
Scarlet the Livery of his Sins, like the rich Glutton, to put him in
Mind of what Means he came to his Wealth and Pre- ferment by. He makes a
Trade of his Eat-</p>

<p>ing, and, like a Cock, ſcrapes when he feeds; for the Public pays for
all and more, which he and his Brethren ſhare among themſelves ; for
they never make a dry Reckoning. When he comes to be Lord-Mayor he does
not keep a great Houſe, but a very great Houſe-warming for a whole Year
; for though he invites all the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Companies</hi> in the City he does not
treat them, but they club to entertain him, and pay the Reckoning
beforehand. His Fur-gown makes him look a great deal bigger than he is,
like the Feathers of an Owl, and when he pulls it off, he looks as if he
were fallen away, or like a Rabbet, had his Skin pulled off.</p>
