Judgement as a Gameſter does/ falſe Dice. The firſt Thing he takes is/
his Oath and his Comiſſion, and afterwards/ the ſtrongeſt Side and
Bribes. He gives Judg-/ ment, as the Council at the Bar are ſaid to
give/ Advice, when they are paid for it. He wraps/ himſelf warm in Furs,
that the cold Air may/ not ſtrike his Conſcience inward. He is never/ an
upright Judge, but when he is weary of/ ſitting, and ſtands for his
Eaſe. Al the Uſe/ he make of his Oath is to oppoſe it againſt/ his
Prince, for whoſe Service he firſt took it,/ and to bind him with that,
which he firſt pre-/ tended to bind himſelf with; as if the King by/
imparting a little of his Power to him gave/ hi to Title to all the
reſt, like thoſe who hold-/ ing a little Land in
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Capite</hi> render all the reſt/</p>
<milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
<p>liable to the ſame Tenure. As for that which/ concerns the People, he
takes his Liberty to do/ what he pleaſes ; this he maintains with Cant-/
ing, of which himſelf being the only Judge,/ he can give it what
arbitrary Interpretation he/ pleaſes ; yet is a great Enemy to
arbitrary/ Power, becauſe he would have no Body uſe it/ but himſelf. If
he have Hope of Preferment/ he makes all the Law run on the King's Side
;/ if not, it always takes part againſt him ; for as/ he was bred to
make any Thing right or wrong/ between Man and Man, ſo he can do
between/ the King and his Subjects. He calls himſelf/
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Capitalis, &amp;c.</hi> which Word he
never uſes but/ to Crimes of the higeſt Nature. He uſurps/ unſufferable
Tyranny over Words ; for when/ he has enſlaved and debaſed them from
their/ original Senſe, he makes them ſerves againſt/ themselves to
ſupport him, and their own/ Abuſe. He is as ſtiff to Delinquents, and/
makes as harſh a Noiſe as a new Cart-wheel,/ until he is greaſed, and
then he turns about as/ eaſily. He called all necceſſary and
unavoidable/ Proceedings of State, without the punctual/ Formality of
Law, arbitrary and illegal, but/ never conſiders, that his own
Interpretation/</p>
<milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
<p>of Law are more arbitrary, and, when he/ pleaſes, illegal. He cannot
be denied to be a/ very impartial Judge ; for right or wrong/ are all
one to him. He takes Bribes, as pious/ Men give Alms, with ſo much
Caution, that/ his right Hand never knows what his left re-/
ceives./</p>
