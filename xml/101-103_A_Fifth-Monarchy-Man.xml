one, that is not contented to be a Privy-/ Counſellor of the Kingdom of
Heave, but/ would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,/ and
tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the/ Kingdom of Earth. His Deſign is
to make/ <hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſt</hi> King, as his
Forefathers the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Jew</hi> did,/ only to
abuſe and crucify him, that he might/ ſhare his Lands and Goods, as he
did his Vice-/ gerents here. He dreams of a Fool's Paradiſe/ without a
Serpent in it, a golden Age all of/ Saints, and no Hypocrites, all
<hi rendition="simple:italic">holy-Court</hi> Princes,/ and no Subjects
but the Wicked; a Govern-/ ment of <hi rendition="simple:italic">Perkin
Warbec</hi> and <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lambert Simnel</hi>/
Saints, where every Man, that had a Mind to it,/ might make himſelf a
Price, and claim a/ Title to the Crown. He fancies a
<hi rendition="simple:italic">fifth-Mo-/ narchy</hi> as the Quinteſſence
of all Governments,/ abſtracted from all Matter, and conſiſting/</p>
<milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
<p>wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and Myſteries./
<hi rendition="simple:italic">John of Leyden</hi> was the firſt Found of
it, and/ though he miſcarried, like
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Romulus</hi> in a Tem-/ peſt, his
Poſterity have Revelations every full/ Moon, that there may be a TIme to
ſet up his/ Title again, and with better Succeſs; though/ his Brethren,
that have attempted to ſince, had/ no ſooner quartered his Coat with
their own,/ but their whole outward Men were ſet on the/ Gates of the
City ; where a Head and four/ Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of
the/ <hi rendition="simple:italic">fifth-Monarchy.</hi> They have been
contriving (ſince/ Experiments, that coſt Necks are too chargea-/ ble)
to try it in little, and have depoſed King/
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Oberon,</hi> to erect their Monarchy in
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Fairy-Land,</hi>/ as being the moſt proper
and natural Region in/ the whole World for their Government, and if/ it
ſucceed there to proceed further. The <hi rendition="simple:italic">De-/
vil's</hi> Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,/ and the Glory of
them, has ſo dazzled their Eyes,/ that they would venture their Necks to
take/ him at his Word, and give him his Price./ Nothing comes ſo near
the Kingdom of Dark-/ neſs as the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">fifth-Monarchy,</hi> that is no where/ to
be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-/ thologies, and myſstical
Riddles, like the Vi-/ ſions <hi rendition="simple:italic">Aeneas</hi>
ſaw in Hell of the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Roman</hi> Empire,/</p>

<hi rendition="simple:italic">Mahomet's</hi> Coming/ to the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Turks,</hi> and King
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Arthur's</hi> Reign over the/ Britons in
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Merlin</hi>'s Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin/
are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you may diſcern/ the ſame Lineaments
in them all. The poor/ Wicked are like to have a very ill time under/
them, for they are reſolved upon arbitrary Go-/ vernment, according to
their ancient and fun-/ damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects/
but Slaves, who between them and the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Devil</hi>/ are like to ſuffer Perſecution
enough to make/ them as able Saints, as their Lords and Maſ-/ ters. He
gather Churches on the Sunday, as/ the
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Jew</hi> did Sitkcs on their Sabbath, to
ſet the/ State on Fire. He humms and hahs high Trea-/ ſon, and calls
upon it, as Gameſters do on the/ Caſt they would throw. He groans
Sedition,/ and, like the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Phariſee,</hi>
rails, when he gives/ Thanks. He interprets Propheſies, as
<hi rendition="simple:italic">Whitting-/ ton</hi> did the Bells, to
ſpeak to him, and governs/ himſelf accordingly./</p>
