  <head>A<lb />FIFTH-MONARCHY-MAN</head>
  <p>I<hi rendition="simple:superscript">2</hi>S one, that is not
  contented to be a Privy-<lb />Counſellor of the Kingdom of Heaven,
  but<lb />would fain be a Miniſter of State of this World,<lb />and
  tranſlate the Kingdom of Heaven to the<lb />Kingdom of Earth. His
  Deſign is to make<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Chriſt</hi> King,
  as his Forefathers the <hi rendition="simple:italic">Jew</hi>
  did,<lb />only to abuſe and crucify him, that he might<lb />ſhare his
  Lands and Goods, as he did his Vice-<lb />gerents here. He dreams of a
  Fool's Paradiſe<lb />without a Serpent in it, a golden Age all
  of<lb />Saints, and no Hypocrites, all
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">holy-Court</hi> Princes,<lb />and no
  Subjects but the Wicked ; a Govern-<lb />ment of
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Perkin Warbec</hi> and
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Lambert Simnel</hi><lb />Saints, where
  every Man, that had a Mind to it,<lb />might make himſelf a Price, and
  claim a<lb />Title to the Crown. He fancies a
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">fifth-Mo-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">narchy</hi>
  as the Quinteſſence of all Governments,<lb />abſtracted from all
  Matter, and conſiſting<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>wholly of Revelations, Viſions, and
  Myſteries.<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">John</hi> of
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Leyden</hi> was the firſt Founder of it,
  and<lb />though he miſcarried, like
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Romulus</hi> in a Tem-<lb />peſt, his
  Poſterity have Revelations every full<lb />Moon, that there may be a
  Time to ſet up his<lb />Title again, and with better Succeſs ;
  though<lb />his Brethren, that have attempted to ſince, had<lb />no
  ſooner quartered his Coat with their own,<lb />but their whole outward
  Men were ſet on the<lb />Gates of the City ; where a Head and
  four<lb />Quarters ſtand as Types and Figures of
  the<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">fifth-Monarchy.</hi> They have
  been contriving (ſince<lb />Experiments, that coſt Necks are too
  chargea-<lb />ble) to try it in little, and have depoſed
  King<lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">Oberon,</hi> to erect their
  Monarchy in <hi rendition="simple:italic">Fairy-Land,</hi><lb />as
  being the moſt proper and natural Region in<lb />the whole World for
  their Government, and if<lb />it ſucceed there to proceed further. The
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">De-</hi><lb /><hi rendition="simple:italic">vil's</hi>
  Proſpect of all the Kingdoms of the Earth,<lb />and the Glory of them,
  has ſo dazzled their Eyes,<lb />that they would venture their Necks to
  take<lb />him at his Word, and give him his Price.<lb />Nothing comes
  ſo near the Kingdom of Dark-<lb />neſs as the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">fifth-Monarchy,</hi> that is no where
  to<lb />be found, but in dark Propheſies, obſcure My-<lb />thologies,
  and myſtical Riddles, like the Vi-<lb />ſions
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Aeneas</hi> ſaw in Hell of the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Roman</hi> Empire.<lb /></p>
  <milestone unit="undefined" type="separator" rendition="line" />
  <p>Next this it moſt reſembles
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Mahomet</hi>’s Coming<lb />to the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Turks,</hi> and King
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Arthur</hi>’s Reign over
  the<lb />Britons in <hi rendition="simple:italic">Merlin</hi>’s
  Propheſies ; ſo near of Kin<lb />are all fantaſtic Illuſions, that you
  may diſcern<lb />the ſame Lineaments in them all. The poor<lb />Wicked
  are like to have a very ill time under<lb />them, for they are
  reſolved upon arbitrary Go-<lb />vernment, according to their ancient
  and fun-<lb />damental Revelations, and to have no Subjects<lb />but
  Slaves, who between them and the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Devil</hi><lb />are like to ſuffer
  Perſecution enough to make<lb />them as able Saints, as their Lords
  and Maſ-<lb />ters. He gathers Churches on the Sunday, as<lb />the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Jews</hi> did Sticks on their Sabbath,
  to ſet the<lb />State on Fire. He humms and hahs high Trea-<lb />ſon,
  and calls upon it, as Gameſters do on the<lb />Caſt they would throw.
  He groans Sedition,<lb />and, like the
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Phariſee,</hi> rails, when he
  gives<lb />Thanks. He interprets Propheſies, as
  <hi rendition="simple:italic">Whitting-<lb />ton</hi> did the Bells,
  to ſpeak to him, and governs<lb />himſelf accordingly.<lb /></p>
