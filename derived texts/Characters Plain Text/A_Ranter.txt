A RANTER

Is a *Fanatic* Hector, that has found out by a
very strange Way of new Light, how to
transform all the *Devils* into *Angels of Light* ;
for he believes all Religion consists in Looseness,
and that sin and Vice is *the whole Duty of Man*.
He puts off the *old Man*, but puts it on again upon
the *new one,* and makes his *Pagan* Vices serve to
preserve his *Christian* Virtues from wearing out ;
for if he should use his Piety and Devotion always it would hold out but a little while.  He
is loth that Iniquity and Vice should be thrown
away, as long as there may be good Use of it ;
for if that, which is wickedly gotten, may
be disposed to pious Uses, why should not
Wickedness itself as well? He believes himself
shot-free against all the Attempts of the *Devil,*
the *World,* and the *Flesh,* and therefore is not
afraid to attack them in their own Quarters,
and encounter them at their own Weapons. 
For as strong Bodies may freely venture to do, 
and suffer that, without any Hurt to themselves, which would destroy those that are 
feeble: so a saint, that is strong in Grace, 
may boldly engage himself in those great sins 
and Iniquities, that would easily damn a weak 
Brother, and yet come off never the worse. 
He believes Deeds of Darkness to be only those 
sins that are committed in private, not those 
that are acted openly and owned.  He is but 
an *Hypocrite* turned the wrong side outward ; 
for, as the one wears his Vices within, and 
the other without, so when they are counterchanged the *Ranter* becomes an *Hypocrite,* and 
the *Hypocrite* an able *Ranter.* His Church is 
the *Devil's* Chappel ; for it agrees exactly both 
in Doctorine and Disicipline with the best reformed Baudy-Houses.  He is a Monster produced 
by the Madness of this latter Age ; but if it 
had been his Fate to have been whelped in old 
*Rome* he had past for a Prodigy, and been received among raining of stones and the speaking of Bulls, and would have put a stop to all 
public Affairs, until he had been expiated. 
*Nero* cloathed *Christians* in the skins of wild 
Beasts ; but he wraps wild Beasts in the skins 
of *Christians*.
