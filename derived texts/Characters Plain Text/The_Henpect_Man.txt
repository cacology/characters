THE 
HENPECT MAN

RIDEs behind his Wife, and lets her 
wear the spurs and governs the Reins.  He 
is a Kind of preposterous Animal, that being 
curbed in goes with his Tail forwards.  He is 
but subordinate and ministerial to his Wife, 
who commands in chief, and he dares do nothing without her Order. she takes Place of him, 
and he creeps in at the Bed’s Feet, as if he had 
married the *Grand seignor*’s Daughter, and is 
under Correction of her Pantofle.  He is his 
Wife’s Villain, and has nothing of his own 
further than she pleases to allow him.  When 
he was married he promised to worship his 
Wife with his soul instead of his Body, and 
endowed her among his worldly Goods with his 
Humanity.  He changed sexes with his Wife, 
and put off the old Man to put on the new 
Woman.  she sits as the Helm, and he does 
but tug like a slave at the Oar.  The little 
Wit he has being held *in capite* has rendered all
the rest of his Concerments liable to Pupilage and Wardship, and his Wife has the
Tuition of his during his or her Life; and
he has no Power to do any Thing of himself,
but by his Guardian. His Wife manages him
and his Estate with equal Authority, and he
lives under her aribtrary Government and Command as his superior Officer. He is but a kind
of Messuage and Tenement in the Occupation
of his Wife. He and she make up a Kind of
 Hermaphrodite, a Monster, or which the one
 half is more than the whole; for he is the
 weaker Vessel, and but his Wife's Helper. His
 Wife espoused and took him to Husband for
 better or worse, and the last Word stands.
 He was meant to be his Wife's Head, but being
 set on at the wrong End she makes him serve
 (like the Jesuits Devil) for her Feet. He is her
 Province, an Acquisition that she took in,
 and gives Laws to at Indiscretion; for being
 overmatched and too feeble for the Encounter,
 he was forced to submit and take Quarter.
 He has inverted the Curse, and turned it upon
 himself; for his Desire is towards his Wife,
 and she reign over him and with *Esau* has
 sold his Birthright for a Mess of Matrimony.

His Wife took his Liberty among his worldly 
Goods, to have and to hold till Death them 
do part.  He is but Groom of his Wife’s 
Chamber, and her menial Husband, that is 
always in waiting, and a slave only in the Right 
of his Wife.
