A
BANKRUPT

Is made by breaking, as a Bird is hatched
by breaking the shell, for he gains more
by giving over his Trade, than ever he did by
dealing in it.  He drives a Trade, as Oliver
Cromwel did a Coach, till it broke in Pieces.
He is very tender and careful in preserving
his Credit, and keeps it as methodically as a
Race-nag is dieted, that in the End he may
run away with it: for he observes a punctual
Curiosity in performing his Word, until he
has improved his Credit as far as it can go;
and then he has catched the Fish, and throws
away the Net ; as a Butcher, when he has fed
his Beast as fat as it can grow, cuts the Throat
of it.  When he has brought his Design to
Perfection, and disposed of all his Materials,
he lays his Train, like a Powder Traytor, and
gets out of the way, while he blows up all
those that trusted him.  After the Blow is
given there is no Manner of Intelligence to be
had of him for some Months, until the Rage
and Fury is somewhat digested, and all Hopes
vanished of ever recovering any Thing of Body,
or Goods, for Revenge, or Restitution; and
then Propositions of Treaty and Accommodation appear, like the sign of the Hand and Pen
out of the Clouds, with Conditions more unreasonable than Thieves are wont to demand
for Restitution of stolen Goods.  He shoots
like a Fowler at a whole Flock of Geese at
once, and stalks with his Horse to come as near
as possibly he can without being perceived by
any one, or giving the least suspicion of his
Design, until it is too late to prevent it; and
then he flies from them, as they should have
done before from him.  His Way is so commonly used in the City, that he robs in a Road,
like a Highwayman, and yet they will never
arrive at Wit enough to avoid it ; for it is done
upon surprise ; and as Thieves are commonly
better mounted than those they rob, he very
easily makes his Escape, and flies beyond Persuit of Huon-cries, and there is no Possibility
of overtaking him.
