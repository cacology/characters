PREFACE.

The writing of Characters was a Kind of Wit much in Fashion in the Beginning of the last Century.  The two principal Authors in this Way were sir Thomas Overbury, and Dr. John Earle Tutor to Prince Charles *in* 1643, *and after* *the Restoration Dean of* Westminster, *and successively Bishop of* Worcester *and* salisbury. *How agreeable these sorts of Essays were to the public* *Taste may be judged from sir* Thomas’s *little Book* 
*having fourteen Editions before* 1632, *and the* 
*Bishop’s six between* 1628 *and* 1633.  *Whether* 
Butler *has equalled or excelled them, and what* 
*Place he is to hold in this Class of Writers must* 
*be left to the Decision of the Public, as the Inte*rest and Prejudice of a Publisher may render me* 
*a suspected or an incompetent Judge.  The Reader* 
*will have an Opportunity of determining for himself, as they have all attempted to draw the same* 
*Pictures.* 
   *As in such a Variety of Characters there must* 
*be some drawn from Originals in general the same,* 
*and only differenced by particular Circumstances,* 
*the same Observations are sometimes repeated.* 
*Whether the Author in this Case requires any Apology must be left to his Judges the Critics it is* 
*enough for me that I can say I have done him* 
*Justice in publishing them.*

   *As most of these Characters are dated when they* 
*were composed, I can inform the curious, that they* 
*were chiefly drawn up from* 1667 *to* 1669, *at* 
*which time, as has been before observed,* Butler 
*resided in* Wales *under the Protection of Lord* 
Carbery.
